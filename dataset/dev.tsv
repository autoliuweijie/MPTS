Pepero encounters the two merchants again and warns them about the wolves. They make fun at him, but shortly after Pepero departs, the wolves attack the merchants and kill them. As Pepero meets again with the group, he gives the plant to their donkey to eat them. Since the wolves are near, the boys build a bonfire and try to repel them with the burning logs. Since they're to numerous and the donkey is feeling better, they decide to ride away from them. Pepero and Kana ride on Jupiter, while Azteco and Chuchu ride on the donkey. As they escape, the donkey, weakened by the disease, stumbles and falls, dropping Azteco and Chuchu. As the wolves are about to attack them, a load of heavy stones fall on the wolves killing many of them. Pepero and the rest notice that the monkey that Kana had helped before and his group were the ones who rescued them this time.	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Ethically-challenged attorney Alan Shore, formerly of Young, Frutt & Berluti, settles in at a wealthy and powerful firm focusing on civil cases. With some help from his friend and mentor, veteran attorney Denny Crane, Shore quickly makes his mark winning cases no one would take, often using less than honest methods. In doing so, he develops a rival in his colleague Brad Chase, who has been assigned to the office partly to keep an eye on the increasingly eccentric (and possibly senile) Denny Crane.

Oz chronicles life inside an experimental cell block in the Oswald Maximum Security Correctional Facility: Level Four called Emerald City. Under unit manager Tim McManus and Warden Leo Glynn, the inmates in Em City all struggle to fulfill their own needs. Some fight for power; either power over the drug trade or power over the other inmate factions. Others want money, either through slinging 'tits' (drugs), gambling or other scams. Others, Corrections officers and inmates alike, simply want to survive long enough to make parole or even to see tomorrow. The show gives a no-holds-barred account of prison life with all the plots, subplots and conflicts given context and explanation by the show's wheelchair-bound narrator, Augustus Hill. OZ chronicles the attempts of McManus (Terry Kinney) to keep control over the inmates of Em(erald) City as well as the drug trade and the violence. There have been many groups of inmates during the run of the show and not everybody makes it out alive. There's the gangstas (Adebisi, Wangler, Redding, Poet, Keene, Supreme Allah), Muslims (Said, Arif, Hamid Khan), Italians (Pancamo, Nappa, Schiebetta), bikers (Hoyt), Aryans (Schillinger, Robson, Mark Mack), Christians (Cloutier, Cudney), Latinos (Alvarez, Morales, Guerra, Hernandez), gays (Hanlon, Cramer) and a whole pile of others (the O'Riley brothers, Keller, Stanislovsky, etc.). And there's a great "everyman" character called Beecher who gives a good look at a normal man who made one tragic mistake. Besides the regular inmates, there's guest stars such as Method Man, Luke Perry, Master P, Treach, etc. and a bunch of prison staff doctors (Dr. Nathan), a nun/psychologist (Sister Peter Marie), a bunch of guards some honest, some crooked and of course the warden Leo Glynn. The whole thing is narrated and held together by inmates Augustus Hill, who provides the show with some context, some sense of theme, etc. and ties everything together really nicely.	0	0	0	0	0	-1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

So when Astwell is found dead shortly after Poirot visits to have dinner with Astwell and view the man's collection of Belgian miniatures, Poirot has many suspects from which to choose. Invited to the home of chemical company CEO Reuben Astwell for dinner and to view Mr. Astwell's collection of Belgian miniatures, Poirot finds Astwell universally disliked and shortly thereafter murdered. But the murder is only one piece of the puzzle when Poirot discovers Astwell's chemical company has developed synthetic rubber so precious that someone has broken into the company to try and steal the formula. Astwell himself is more than willing to sell it to the highest bidder, even the Nazis. With Captain Hastings playing in a weekend golf tournament, Hercule Poirot goes along, not for the golf, but for the opportunity to view Sir Reuben Astwell's collection of Belgian miniatures. Poirot and Hastings are invited for dinner and the miniatures are indeed exquisite but the company is not as Sir Reuben proves to be a nasty and overbearing boor of a man. Everyone dislikes him including his wife, his brother, his employees and his nephew Charles, who is arrested for his murder after his body is found in his study. One area of disagreement was Sir Reuben's decision to license their new formula to the German chemical giant, I.G Farben which, with war clouds forming over 1930s Europe, some think is unpatriotic.

They keep their cool, knowing that given the heightened racial tensions, the wrong thing said could spark deadly violence, and are assisted by a young resident who helps to keep the peace. Sgt. MacDonald is concerned about Reed's heavy handed "judge and jury" dealing with a charged child molester, especially as Reed is still on his first year probation. Reed later admits that the thought of his own still unborn child affected his judgment. As continuing such behavior could cause a problem for Reed's career, Malloy vows to the sergeant to keep an eye on Reed with regard to this issue. Malloy figures their calls for the day may be a good starting point for Reed in handling his feelings with regard to possible child harm cases. The first is a woman suspecting that her former neighbors who just moved and who she didn't like killed their two year old daughter based on their past behavior and the rotting smell emanating from somewhere in their back yard. The second is a chronic home invasion in which a child is used to exploit the situation. Their final call is at an armed robbery at a supermarket, where race relations plays a large role in the outcome. At the end of the day, Reed still doesn't know if he can make it as a cop if he has to deal with child harm, but Malloy has other beliefs.

25961_51075	 In an attempt to snare the enigmatic art thief Marrascaud, Poirot and the Metropolitan Police set an irresistible trap: at the society debut of wealthy aristocrat Lucinda Le Mesurier, a priceless painting called 'Hercules Vanquishing the Hydra' by Marrascaud's favorite artist will be displayed, with Lucinda wearing exquisite diamond jewelery. A confident Poirot is convinced the criminal will be apprehended, but he does not foresee the eventual, disastrous outcome: not only does Marrascaud pinch the painting, but Lucinda herself is brutally murdered, and her jewels are stolen as well. The catastrophe weights heavily on Poirot's conscience, and he sinks into a steady depression, despite the entreaties of his physician, Dr Burton. Three months after Lucinda's murder, a lonely chauffeur asks Poirot to find his true love, the maid of celebrated Russian ballerina Katrina Samoushenka. Pitying the man, Poirot agrees to reunite the lovers pro bono and sets off to the Hotel Olympos in Rochers Neiges, Switzerland, where Katrina is supposedly staying. Run by the hearty (yet corrupt) Italian Francesco, the hotel is world-famous for its Alpine spa treatments, and much to Poirot's surprise, it is also Marrascaud's current hideout. But what identity has the villain taken? Among the guests, Poirot not only finds the bedridden Katrina, but also her imperious Austrian psychotherapist Dr Lutz, M.P. Harold Waring, who has shouldered the blame for an illicit scandal involving his superior, bossy Mrs Rice and her daughter Elsie Clayton, whose abusive husband is also staying at the hotel, parlor-game enthusiast Schwartz, and the only woman who has ever stirred his heart: former jewel thief Countess Vera Rossakoff, whose criminologist daughter Alice Cunningham is also present, along with her unsightly pet bulldog, Binky. A motley crew, indeed, and just as impenetrable. When an avalanche strands the guests, it becomes even more imperative to find Marrascaud. But several distractions prevent Poirot from facing his nemesis. Why is Katrina being deliberately evasive about the fate of her maid? Why does Dr Lutz have such a powerful hold on her? Why does Elsie's husband always dine in his room? What is Countess Rossakoff doing in Switzerland, and has she really given up her life of thievery? Why is Schwartz so hard to read? What happened to the old servant, Robert, and why is his replacement so inexperienced? Who tried to frighten Alice? As more and more questions pile up, less and less time remains as Poirot strives towards redemption for his past mistakes. But will he succeed in battling his inner demons as Hercules succeeded in conquering his twelve Labours, or will Marrascaud be the first criminal to prevail against the Belgian detective? Poirot is more than depressed after a police operation to nab the renowned thief Marrascaud go very bad. Not only does the thief get away with a valuable painting, the master thief gets hold of a valuable diamond necklace killing its owner in the process. Poirot heads to Switzerland to a remote hotel, high atop a mountain and accessible only by funicular. There he finds a mixed lot of fellow travelers including the Countess Rossakoff - whom Poirot knows and greatly admires - and her daughter Alice Cunningham. Others include a mother and daughter, a British MP under a dark cloud, and a Russian ballerina who is ill and under the care of her doctor. En route to the hotel, Poirot learns from the Swiss police the Marrascaud is at the hotel, but as he soon finds, almost everyone there is a suspect. Hercule Poirot is depressed: he set a trap for ruthless killer and master-thief Marrascaud and the woman who was wearing the jewels as bait is now dead. Furthermore, Marrascaud escaped with the jewels and a priceless painting. A romantic errand sees him in Switzerland, at a hotel high in the Alps. Coincidentally, the local police are staking out the hotel, as they expect Marrascaud to be arriving there. His interest piqued, and eager to catch the criminal who has eluded him, Poirot joins in the attempt to unmask Marrascaud. One of the guests is Countess Rossakoff, an old friend of Poirot's whom he hasn't seen in many years. Moreover, his affection for her seems to exceed that of friendship.

54926_80631	 After finding a type of dilithium which can survive at a higher temperatures, Tom Paris comes up with the ingenious idea of attempting to cross the transwarp threshold in an attempt to find a way to get home faster. After a bumpy start and the help of Torres and Kim, they succeed in a holodeck simulation. When it is presented to Captain Janeway, she is impressed and gives them the go ahead to try it, but traveling faster than warp 10 has never before been attempted. The first run goes very well. Tom Paris manages to cross the warp threshold which means that the shuttle craft in which he is traveling exists simultaneously everywhere. But Tom then disappears and Harry is unable to find him anywhere within five parsecs. Tom somehow manages to return to Voyager through subspace, but there are unforeseen side-effects of his transwarp travel and Tom begins to mutate. The doctor tries to treat him with a type of radiation that will prohibit cell mutation, however this fails and Tom dies. To the Doctor's surprise, Paris is able to regenerate himself and wakes up a couple of hours later with two hearts! His body continues mutating, with new organs growing and others being absorbed back in to his body. Tom refuses any treatment, saying that this is the best thing that ever happened to him but deep down he is scared. A cure is found by exposing Tom to highly focused anti-proton radiation to destroy all the new DNA and allowing his original DNA to reassert itself. However, Tom breaks free from his restraints, kidnaps Captain Janeway, takes the shuttle craft to transwarp. Captain Janeway's DNA goes through the same mutagenic process as Tom's. When Voyager catches up with them on an alien planet three days later, Paris and Janeway have devolved millions of years and have mated, producing three offspring. Commander Chakotay recovers Paris and Janeway but makes the decision to leave their offspring on the otherwise unpopulated planet.	 The Enterprise is en route to Star Station India when receive a distress signal from the USS Lantree, a Federation supply ship. When they arrive, they find everyone aboard the Lantree dying of what seems to be old age. They proceed to the Lantree's last port of call, the Darwin genetic research facility on Gagarin IV only to find that they too are suffering from rapid aging. Picard and Dr. Pulaski clash when she brings aboard one of the children from the station and in order to complete her examination, takes him aboard a shuttle craft in order to isolate him from the Enterprise crew. She is soon infected however and seems doomed to die of old age but Picard may have a solution. Answering Federation cargo USS Lantree's weak, disappearing distress call, the Enterprise can only find every person aboard dead from extremely accelerated aging, cause unknown, so they quarantine and mark it. Checking on its last 'port' of call, genetic research station Gagarin IV on an isolated planet, they find its staff afflicted with the same epidemic, albeit in an early stage. Picard isn't inclined to allow aboard the genetically improved children from the obviously quarantined base, none of whom shows any symptoms. Dr. Pulaski however, who has a relevant research background, persuades him to allow beaming one child to a safe space: a drifting shuttle, manned by her and presumably immune Data. The first brief contact already infects her, so she joins the quarantine, but theoretically a cure may be found be adjusting the very transporter she always tries to avoid. The Enterprise responds to a distress call from the USS Lantree, and find her crew dead, apparently from old age. The investigation leads them to a research station on Gagarin IV, where Pulaski and the station's staff undergo rapid aging from genetically enhanced children.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

65625_69732	 SG-9's anthropologist Frakes is captured during a mission on a planet of cave-dwellers, where direct sunlight is unbearable, and killed by their own Captain Jonas Hansen, who became a murderous tyrant after being treated like a god by the primitive inhabitants, drunk with power, and has them build a temple in his honor well beyond their primitive means and manpower. His escaped team mate Lieutenant Connor refuses to return with SG-1, which soon finds him captured and tied up in the sun with other non-collaborating team survivors. Captain Samantha Carter allows herself to be captured trying to free them, so she can talk to Hanson, an ex of hers, who claims the temple should save the people when he as 'their god' installs an old goa'uld device he expects her to repair. When Teal'c hears about it from local escapee Jamala, he warns hat technology can only create a field between two devices, so SG-1 must find a second one, then overpower the false god... The SG-1 team go to a planet in search of SG-9. They find one member of the team, Lt. Connor who tells them the SG-9 team leader, Capt. Jonas Hanson, has gone mad. He's not only convinced the simple inhabitants that he is a god but he's come to think that he is in fact a god. The planet has an extremely high UV factor that limits how long anyone can stay in the sun. Hanson has the locals building him a temple and has promised them eternal salvation. He's also cruel, punishing anyone who goes against him by tying them a stake in the deadly sunlight. He also has a device that he believes is a shield of some sort but is unable to operate it. He wants Sam Carter, who has a history with Hanson, to get it working for him. Connor and Frakes from the SG-9 are hunted down by natives from a planet and Frakes is captured and killed by an earthling. O'Neill, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c arrive in the planet that has a lethal sunlight seeking out the SG-9 team and they find Connor that tells that their Captain Jonas Hansen is crazy and has executed Frakes. He explains that Hansen is treated like a god by the primitive inhabitants and power has corrupted him and he has become a tyrant. O'Neill decides to stay to investigate and Connor is captured by the inhabitants and tied up in the sun to die. Samantha, who was Hansen's fiancée, decides to turn herself in to talk to Hansen. But he realizes that he is completely nuts and is forced to help him to repair and activate a shield device left by the Goa'ulds. Meanwhile O'Neill, Teal'c and Daniel captures a local called Jamala and Teal'c tells that the shield requires to devices to be activated and he knows how to do it. Now they need to convince the inhabitants that Hanse is not a god.	 At Starbase 173, the crew have a bit of leave. Data learns some of the intricacies of playing poker while Captain Picard runs into an old friend of a sort, Captain Phillipa Louvois, who established a new JAG office at the base. She once prosecuted him, unsuccessfully, but there is admiration at least, on both sides. Problems arise however when Commander Bruce Maddox receives permission to disassemble Data to determine how he functions. When Data expresses doubts about Maddox's likelihood of success, he refuses to undergo the procedure and resigns his commission. He soon finds himself the center of a judicial inquiry to determine if he is just a machine and a piece of property or a sentient being who has the right to make his own decisions. Captain Louvois finds herself sitting in judgment with Captain Picard defending Data's claim against Commander Riker who is forced to present the opposing arguments. Commander Bruce Maddox visits the Enterpsied, docked at a star base, to claim Data as ultimate test subject for his study of his creator's revolutionary android type, confident it will teach him enough to create many more such superior robots.Data objects, as the intended tests are neither fully safe nor optimally prepared in theory. Told he must submit under Starfleet orders, Data prefers resigning, but Maddox challenges his right to do so on the grounds of not being a (legal) person. The matter comes to court, presided by Picard's legal nemesis Phillipa Louvois, who commandeers him to defend Data and Riker to act as prosecutor. For lack of proper legal grounds, both sides discourse rather philosophically on the nature of personality, intelligence and free choice, analyzing Data's own acts, opinions and choices.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

29071_70191	 The Inter-Galaxy Corporation is launching a rocket to either Mars or Venus. Martin needs to convince them to choose Mars, so that he can stowaway and get home. J.M. Buckley, Inter-Galaxy's President, is an indecisive man, but is highly superstitious and makes many decisions on these superstitions. He is leaning toward sending the rocket to Mars, but two things are distracting him from making the announcement of such: it's Friday the 13th, and he's missing his lucky rabbit's foot. Martin overcomes the date superstition by making Buckley think that Friday the 13th is the luckiest day on the calendar. The missing rabbit's foot on the other hand Martin and Tim need to find. They locate it, but in cat-chewed state. Martin realizes that many rabbit's feet look similar and he uses his powers to recreate it to its original visual state. That's all Buckley needs to make the announcement to send the rocket to Mars, the launch to take place in two days. To thank the corporation, Martin suggests adding a magnetic oscilloscope, an invaluable piece of equipment for the mission, to the rocket. This act of kindness on Martin's part is also his error: with the addition of the oscilloscope, there is no more room for a stowaway.

35087_114340	 Exploring a strange and beautiful garden, SG-1 comes across a dome containing a race that are connected to machines. The team are captured by the machines and rendered unconscious, but awake to find themselves reliving pivotal moments of their lives, over and over again. Then they discover it is virtual reality and a mysterious keeper appears to persuade them to try different outcomes for the moments. But can the team escape his clutches, when they don't know what is real and what is not? SG-1 arrives on a beautiful planet, like a giant garden, only nobody seems to live there, except inside a giant dome-shaped structure, where everything is artificial and machine-controlled, the only humanoid inhabitants are locked, apparently unconscious, inside machines which tap into their bodies. Before they can properly investigate, the machines' metallic tentacles catch them and lock into their own minds and bodies. Teal'c awakes with Jack in a recreation of his traumatic mission in East Germany, when O'Neill and Captain Charles Kawalsky's team failed with fatal results, and as soon as the same tragic end has been reached it starts again. Similarly, Sam awakes with Daniel Jackson in the New York Museum where and when his parents, archaeologists Melburn and Claire Jackson, were crushed to death while setting up an Egyptian exposition, and as a five-year old in their eyes unable to prevent their death, again restarting the nightmare. As soon as each pair realizes to be in a time-loop and wants out, the same figure appears, calling himself the Keeper of the dome and everything that is, was and can be, enthusiastically recommending they further 'enjoy' the possibilities to live variations of those grand moments, and soon they also notice a series of silent figures in robes like the keeper. Now they refuse to 'play anymore' and wake up, released by the machines and return trough the star-gate, but find general Hammond as insistent they immediately return to the planet that Jack concludes it's not really him, and indeed... The SG-1 team visit a planet that has a large geodesic dome. Inside, they find humans in containers the purpose of which is not clear to them. Soon, all four members of the team are drawn into the same machines with Jack and Teal'c awakening in a strange place. Jack knows that the reality they find themselves in cannot be real as it's a re-creation of a mission he went on in 1982. Sam and Daniel meanwhile awaken in the New York Museum of Art where Daniel sees his parents killed while setting up a new exhibition. What they learn is that the moment can be relived over and over again and they have the ability to change the outcome. The Keeper, who controls their environment, encourages them to find happier solutions to the events in their lives they had always hoped to re-do. It's an enticing prospect but Jack and Daniel refuse to play The Keeper's game. SG-1 visits a world and finds itself in a large beautiful garden, but then they find out that all people on the world are tied to some machines. Suddenly the team members are captured by empty machines and they find themselves in other places. Colonel Jack O'Neill and Teal'c are in a wooded area to meet other human soldiers from Earth, including Charles Kawalsky, who died one year ago. O'Neill recognizes this as the time of an undercover mission in East Germany, 1982, where Kawalsky died. The soldiers act as Teal'c is one of them, calling him "Thomas". Thinking that they might have traveled through time, O'Neill again goes through the mission in hope of fixing their first mistake, but all goes wrong and the mission re-starts from the beginning. O'Neill isn't able to change the outcome after several tries. Dr. Daniel Jackson and Captain Samantha Carter find themselves in a museum when his parents were killed by falling stones. He also fails several times trying to change the event. O'Neill and Teal'c they are visited by a strange man called the "Keeper", who offers them the possibility to change the past - be it only in a simulation - and also tells Daniel and Carter same. All SG-1 members then refuse to take part in this simulations anymore. The Keeper reunites the team members and tells them 1000 years ago a chemical disaster took place destroying this world. The whole civilizations entered stasis, and now want more scenarios for their virtual world. As Teal'c's and Carter's brain can't be accessed, the Keeper lets them take part in the simulations of their friends. (Jaffa are apparently immune to the process and Sam's mind has been altered by Jolinar of Malkshur). Many people (inhabitants of the virtual world) listen to the conversation and react when they hear that the outside world has recovered. The Keeper sends them away and appears to let SG-1 go free. Returning to Earth, they are checked in the infirmary and report to Major General George S. Hammond. He tells them to go back for more information about this virtual world, which would have them hooked up to the machines again. This is uncharacteristic behavior for Hammond, leading SG-1 to conclude that they are still in the VR. O'Neill attacks the General who orders them to be arrested. In the cell they are visited by Kawalsky who tells them to simply should stay the VR. SG-1 escapes, meets the residents of the VR, who inquire about the outside world. They tell of a beautiful garden outside showing the residents their planets from SG-1's memories. Keeper, disguised as Hammond, shuts off the gate before they can go through. Chasing him, they accidentally discover the exit doors the Keeper has been trying hide from his people, and everyone exits VR. The Keeper is captured in the garden and explains he kept his people in VR because they would repeating their former mistakes ruining the garden and finally the whole world. Suddenly realizing that the people have already left the VR and are picking flowers in garden and pick flowers, the Keeper becomes fruitlessly angry. SG-1 returns to Earth promising to return and help the residents begin new lives. Jack, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c arrive in a garden on the planet P7J-989 and soon they find the inhabitants are tied by tubes to weird machines in a dome. Out of the blue, they are hold by four machines. Jack and Teal'c awake on East Germany where they meet other soldiers and Jack recalls that it was a failed mission that he had participated where soldiers died. Jack unsuccessfully tries to take the correct actions to save the soldiers and the event happens several times. Meanwhile Daniel and Sam awake in the New York Museum of Art and they witness the accident that killed Daniel's parents. Daniel unsuccessfully tries to save them. Soon they are visited by the Keeper, who tells that they are attached to the machines and they have the change to fix the past in that simulation. What are the intentions of the Keeper to use their memories in the virtual reality?

4839_105325	 Emily Hammond is killed in her flat by a fetishist who makes up and wigs her corpse,the slaying recalling the murders thirty years earlier by a serial killer the Shoreditch Creeper,who had connections with Emily's house. At the same time Ripley is introduced by embittered Erin Gray to creepy,'unretired' superintendent Stark, anxious to nail Luther for killing people who eluded justice and taking the law into his own hands. Stark and Gray put a wire on Ripley as he and Luther investigate the apparently ritual murder of obscene Internet troll Jared Cass. Prime suspect is Ken Barnaby, who was plagued by Cass with taunts over his dead daughter but Luther feels sorry for him,warning him of likely arrest which spurs Ken to take extreme action. Luther finds romance with Mary Day after they literally bump into each other in a traffic prang but the killer strikes again,murdering Dani Lane, who was Emily's baby-sitter in the 1980s, and her husband. DCI John Luther investigates the murder of Emily Hammond who is found strangled in her bed and costumed by her killer. Luther thinks he's seen this before and is reminiscent of a serial killer, the Shoreditch Creeper, who in 1980-81 assaulted 8 women, killing 3 times. The crimes then inexplicably stopped. He's barely started when he's told by his boss Supt. Martin Shenk that he's been ordered to assign him to another case, the murder of Jared Cass who was also found dead that morning. He ends up with both cases. Cass was known to attack people via the Internet and his death seems to be a revenge killing. One of his victims was Ken Barnaby who is still grieving over the death of his daughter Kathy. When Luther asks him to come to the station to provide fingerprints he reacts. As for the Hammond case, the police find a link to the 30 year old murders while the serial killer strikes again. Meanwhile Luther's Sergeant, DS Justin Ripley, learns that Superintendent Stark has been brought out of retirement to investigate Luther. Following the murder of Emily Hammond, Luther is put on the case of a fetishist killer. Ripley is persuaded by Erin Gray, now DCI under formerly retired DSU George Stark, to monitor Luther's movements on a case regarding the murder of Jared Cass. Stark hopes to expose Luther as a corrupt cop, and with Luther's attention divided and stress escalating, Ripley finds himself in a compromising position.	 A man is found dead in a cemetery. The wound on his chest indicates that he died from a bullet wound, yet the CSIs found nothing but small pieces of paper inside it. The second case is of a dead woman found blindfolded with her hands tied behind her back in her fancy bed. The investigation leads the detectives to a restaurant that serves exotic food such as centipedes, live octopus, and cockroaches.	-1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

A message from Apophis plays to say that the traitors who took his property would die in the cold of space. Can the SGC find a way to bring them back, or will they die drifting ever further from Earth? While testing the X301, a hybrid fighter built from human and Goa'uld technology, O'Neil and Teal'c find the aircraft is no longer under their control as they are drawn into deep space. They then receive a recorded message from Apophis telling them that what is his will now be returned to him. Teal'c assumes there are devices in the parts they used that will send them home. That will take several hundred years however. The only hope of rescue is a Tok'ra scout ship that is a day away but on a secret mission to a Goa'uld world. Sam and Daniel head to that world and find that it's Sam's father who is conducting the mission. They leave immediately but their calculations indicate that Teal'c and O'Neill will be dead by the time they arrive.

First it was snowing, which Luffy and Usopp found an activity to do including snow ball fights and snowman building. Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday were complaining that there's no heater.

When it all got calm, Zoro woke up from his nap and found them all exhausted on deck. Sanji, Usopp and Nami were angry that Zoro didn't do a thing during his nap. Zoro noticed Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday, and didn't know they were helping out 2 individuals while he was sleeping. Nami explained to him that their taking them home to Whiskey Peak.

Then an island was spotted where Whiskey Peak is. On Cactus Island, a cacti shape island. Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday thanked them for helping them get back to their island.

As our heroes landed at the pier, they were welcomed by the mayor of Whiskey Peak: Igarappoi(a tall, curly haired man with an irritated throat). He introduces them to the island's hospitality and celebration to having pirates visit their town. Luffy, Usopp and Sanji went ahead to enjoy themselves.

Whiskey Peak, according to Igarappoi their town is famous for the quality in fine wine from the best grapes you'll ever taste. Nami entered the traditional Kanpai Contest(because the prize is 100,000 Belli) with Zoro for an extra chance to win the money. Luffy ate non stop, Sanji flirted with 20 women at once, and Usopp goes on about his experience with the Calm Blet(which the locals believe is all true, but it ain't). Meanwhile Miss Wednesday and Mr. 9 wrote out a report, that they failed to kill Laboon, but have successfully lured a group of pirates for bounty. Miss Wednesday took the report and put it in an Unluckies Box(special mailbox) so that way it'll go directly to their boss. Zoro was already past out, so Nami and a nun were the last 2 remaining at the drinking contest. Nami won, but past out, as well as Luffy, Usopp and Sanji. and the party was already over after they're all tired out. Igarappoi went outside to be meted by Mr. 9 and Miss Wednesday. It's revealed that Igarappoi works for them as Mr. 8, who plans to get the 30,000,000 Belli bounty on Luffy and the others. The nun from the drinking contest came out and revealed to herself as Miss Monday(a black bodybuilding woman). They all plan to take the Straw Hat Pirates alive for the bounty award money. Zoro overheard all of this, and gave their attention. They saw him sitting on the roof and presumed that he was worn out like the others. But a great swordsman like Zoro, doesn't let alcohol get to him. He knows that Mr. 8, and the others work for Baroque Works. Zoro knows about this organization, because he was offered a job in it a while back. But refused because of the sue of code names and the boss's identity being a secret to all the members who serve in it. And Zoro knows that all the citizens of Whiskey Peak are bounty hunters who welcome the pirates who come here, and kill them while they're drunk and worn out. All those dead pirates are buried on the Cactus Rocks. Igarappoi sends everyone to get Zoro, only to find him gone without a trace. Who or what is Baroque Works?

29345_35332	 The new plan of the McKay-Carter Subway Station is under way. The Atlantis Team needs to harvest space gates in order to form the Galactic Bridge. Sheppard disagrees with McKay's plan to steal the gates and they go in for first contact with the "back water hamlets" as McKay calls it. As they walk into the city, they are greeted by a man called Lucius, who has the locals eating out of his hand. Everyone is hanging on this man's every word and so is Carson. He's completely smitten with him and Lucius now knows the location and the thriving existence of Atlantis. It appears, as Lucius explains, that he has an herb that makes him appealing to everyone. He later on exploits this until the locals experience withdrawal symptoms from the herb and they grow sick. Everyone in Atlantis is smitten and do what ever he wishes. Sheppard has totally had it and kidnaps Carson and forces him to make an antidote, while he is still in withdrawal. Sheppard and the team continue their visits to new planets. McKay is tired of all these visits and is keen on implementing a series of gates that will allow them to travel from Atlantis to Earth in a mere 30 minutes without using the power of a ZPM or the two weeks it takes them on the Daedalus. He takes a somewhat different tack however when he sees all of the very friendly young women in the village. Their leader, Lucius Lavin, seems to be a very affable sort and has the locals eating out of their hands. He claims to be an apothecary of sorts and have a cure for every disease, which is certainly of interest to Dr. Beckett. Lavin is invited to Atlantis and soon everyone, including Elizabeth Weir and McKay have fallen victim to his charms. It's left to Sheppard to sort it all out.	 Tom and the remnants of the 2nd Mass learn to pilot a Beamer as part of their plan to destroy the Espheni Power Core, and the group draws straws to see who will embark on the dangerous mission.

After our heroes encounter more behavior out of character, including each-others, it becomes clear none of them is the actual person, here's a supernatural shape-shifter, and Hercules knew as a child the perfect suspect: Proteus, a minor god...

14685_99123	 Transformers Prime deepens the epic mythology of both the AUTOBOTS and DECEPTICONS, while starting fresh for a new generation of viewers and future fans. OPTIMUS PRIME, BUMBLEBEE, ARCEE, RATCHET, BULKHEAD, and many others are back to "roll out" against MEGATRON's latest attempt to conquer Earth. And MEGATRON proves to be more powerful than ever, having acquired a rare element that allows him mastery over life itself. 'Team Prime' may be few against the DECEPTICON hordes, but they find increased strength via bonds forged with three human teenagers. Make no mistake, TRANSFORMERS PRIME WILL deliver heavy metal action, and nail-biting suspense -- but it also promises to take the human drama to levels as yet unseen by the franchise.	 Annelotte arrives at the throne room and is confronted by Sigui. The two battle to a draw, but "Ymir" shows up and threatens Luna Luna, Tarnyang and Sainyang who are stuck in the jelly in the small moat around the throne. Mirim, the real Ymir and Eilin arrive to expose Melona, and Sainyang frees her comrades from the jelly using magic so that Luna Luna can grab Melona with her tentacles. Melona reveals her true form and traps Luna Luna, Tarnyang and Sainyang in jelly once again. Melona then proceeds to go on to explain about how everything is going according to the Swamp Witch's plan and even Claudette is not opposing the Swamp Witch. Claudette walks out and charges up her sword, but to Melona's surprise Claudette blows her up first. Deep within the castle, Maria frees Risty from prison before running off. Claudette states that she will maintain order with power and all who opposes her will be crushed. Luna Luna (now free because Melona got blown up) and Mirim attack Claudette but Claudette bounce them out of the tower. Fortunately, Yuit and Vante fly up just in time they catch Luna Luna and Mirim on the way. Because Claudette stated that God is no longer needed and claimed she was the only supreme being, Sigui switches sides and attacks Claudette with her fire, but Claudette repels the attack. Claudette then charges up lightning in her sword. Seeing an opportunity, Tarnyang and Sainyang try to block the attack with a barrier, but the ensuing explosion destroys the top of the tower. Laila arrives at the palace after learning from Izumi that Maria had gone to Gainos. Laila finds Ymir and Eilin and they are joined in the stands by mini-Melona to watch the action. Meanwhile, Mirim finds that Tarnyang and Sainyang are not breathing. Sigui jumps in and uses her Holy Pose: Healing to attempt to revive Tarnyang and Sainyang. Claudette reappears and tosses out some lightning which Mirim tries to block, and the explosion knocks out Sigui and Mirim. Annelotte charges in with her horse Ambrosius and a combined regular/demonic attack, but Claudette defeats her with a swing of her sword. Claudette unleashes lightning to finish Annelotte off, but Maria arrives to block the attack. Claudette recognizes Maria, but Maria falls asleep. Claudette hesitates and thinks about striking Maria down, but Annelotte puts herself before Maria. Seemingly struck by the determination in Annelotte's eyes, Claudette retreats and tells Annelotte's group to leave. Tarnyang and Sainyang come to, and Annelotte's gang leaves the castle and Annelotte tells her gang to get stronger and regroup in several months to start the real rebellion. Having watched the fight, Melona complains about the anti-climactic ending, but then Laila shoots Melona with Holy Milk and takes Melona back the heavens for her report. Several months later, Annelotte and gang (now including Sigui) meet up in the Calibara tribe's sacred ruins. Vante is used to activate the Great Power statue and the ruins rise up into what appears to be a fortress to rival the Queen's fortress in Gainos.	1	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Lex's brother, Julian, reveals himself to Lionel in an effort to clear the air between all parties involved. With Clark still imprisoned in the Fortress of Solitude and Kara still missing, 'Bizaro' has taken over Clark's life in Smallville and an unsuspecting Lana as his trophy.

Jor-El then releases Clark from his imprisonment to stop Bizaro. Meanwhile, Grant reveals his secret to Lionel who then confronts Lex about his secret cloning research.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Endora crashes the party with gift in hand: a painting of a woman that looks like Samantha, but who Samantha claims is her Great Aunt Cornelia. What disturbs Darrin is that it was painted by the Leonardo Da Vinci and is in the exact same style as the Mona Lisa. Being disturbed changes to being horrified when Endora prominently hangs the portrait for the Tates to see, Louise falling in love with it, and she wanting the supposed painter to paint her portrait, that painter who Endora reveals to be Darrin. To get out of this mess, Darrin allows Samantha to use her witchcraft for this one time only to allow him to paint a nice portrait of Louise.

Michael is in a quandary concerning what to do about Eleanor ever since she admitted that she is a fraud and is in the good place by mistake. What makes the situation even worse for him is that no one in his position in the good place has ever had to deal with such an error, and Janet is still rebooting her system following being murdered by who he now assumes was Eleanor, meaning that Michael via Janet can't yet get access to Eleanor's file. So beyond the bare minimum of having an interview with Eleanor to learn directly from her her story, he decides to have an interview with who seem to be her closest friends in the neighborhood, namely Tahani, Jianyu and most specifically Chidi. Those latter three interviews may cause even more problems for especially Jianyu and Chidi as Eleanor learns and passes along to her friends that Michael has a lie detecting machine, meaning that Jianyu also may be exposed as a fraud, and Chidi identified as Janet's real murderer. As such, Tahani, Jianyu and Chidi have to decide what best to do, not only for Eleanor, each who has his/her own position about what should happen to her, but for themselves and their own standing in the good place.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	-1	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Groucho could always be counted on to enliven the banter with his unique blend of comedy and wit. After talking with Groucho for several minutes, the contestants chose quiz questions from a category they had preselected and, if they answered them correctly, won money.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0
7441_99464	 Detectives Briscoe and Logan investigate the death of Kevin Jeffries, an autistic teenager who died while in police custody. The medical examiner determines that he died from a blood clot - and not from anything the police may have done during the arrest - but also reports that he had bruises on his body. Kevin was living at a behavioral modification clinic but constantly ran away. The clinic admits they kept him in restraints, particularly on those bad days when he was deemed injurious to himself. The head of the clinic, Dr. Alan Colter, generally used aversion therapy to treat his patients. This included electric shocks and a black box that created a complete sensory deprived environment. Colter clearly exceeded New York State guidelines on the use of electric shock and as far as ADA McCoy is concerned, it amounted to torture. The biggest hurdle he will have to overcome are the parents who support Colter and his methods.

Nothing sinister is suspected until his home is broken into and his golf clubs stolen. Stewart pursues another golfer,Eddie Curtis,who also disappears,the trail leading to a casino in London,which is part of a smuggling ring using the golfing circuit.	 Whilst off-world, the team is attacked by giant insects, one of which stings Teal'c on the back. The bug has actually implanted a virus that converts Teal'c into a living incubator for hundreds of more insects and Teal'c is being eaten alive. The only way to save him is to capture another venomous bug and create an antidote, but time is running out. On a mission to a highly developed planet with a humanoid, urbanized civilization, SG-1 is attacked by a swarm of the giant winged insects which eradicated the native people. Teal'c gets stung in the back, and despite his symbiont, which protects against most other medical hazards, is badly affected. Colonel Harry Maybourne sees his chance to order Teal'c arrested, and Dr. Timothy Harlow, the leading genetics researcher consulted at Sam's recommendation, concludes the venom acts like a 'retrovirus', transforming victim DNA in its own, so the victim's body becomes a swarm of about ten bugs. Teal'c escapes, but his symbiont stays behind, is found alive, which robs him of his last delaying advantage. Jack and Daniel accept and succeed in the dangerous mission to return and bring in a bug, so the venom can be studied to make a cure against the clock. Meanwhile Teal'c hides in a ghetto, braves the street gangs and is found and helped by playing teenage girl Allie. Jack is determined to find Teal'c before Maybourne's men do, or worse, metamorphosis becomes irreversible... While SG-1 visits a modern planet much like Earth, they are unable to find any sign of inhabitants. The deserted city is not devoid of life however and Teal'c is attacked and stung by a large flying bug. He's been infected with a virus-like substance and it's obviously spreading. The infection is so powerful the even his symbiont can't seem to protect him. Samantha Carter suggests they call in Dr. Timothy Harlow, a expert in the field but even he is stumped. Their real problem however comes in the form of Col. Harry Maybourne who has orders to remove Teal'c to the Area 51 research facility for further study. He manages to escape and goes into hiding but finding him becomes all the more important when they learn that Teal'c has become an incubus that will produce and release some of the flying bugs on Earth. Jack, Sam, Daniel and Teal'c visit a desert planet with skyscrapers and buildings but no living soul. Out of the blue, they are attacked by giant bugs and Teal'c is stung by one insect. The SG-1 needs to flee back home when a swarm of bugs fly toward them. Dr. Janet Fraiser examines Teal'c's infection and realizes that the virus left by the bug is killing Teal'c and his symbiotic is not healing him. Further, in his blood there is also a different DNA. Sam suggests to General Hammond to summon the prominent Dr. Timothy Harlow, who is an authority in DNA research. Soon Colonel Harry Maybourne comes to the SGC to take Teal'c with him. Hammond does not succeed to contact the President to overrule the order and Maybourne and his men take Teal'c in a van. However, Teal'c manages to escape and hides in an old building where the girl Ally helps him. Meanwhile the SG-1 returns to the planet to capture one bug alive for research and discovers what has happened to the inhabitants of the planet that were covered by a cocoon and transformed into several bugs. When Ally meets Teal'c against, he is covered by a cocoon. Will Teal'c be transformed into bugs too?	-1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

46066_103745	 When teenagers who were reported missing are suspected of a series of mass murders in Chicago, the BAU investigates their whereabouts to find a motive for the crimes. Also, Morgan has conflicting feelings when his girlfriend takes her job at a hospital as seriously as he takes his. Morgan is perturbed by a recent event in his new relationship with his current girlfriend Savannah, that event which Garcia is able to shed some light on for him. Meanwhile, the team heads to Chicago, Illinois where sixteen year old Gavin Rossler opened fire in a downtown diner, killing three before being shot dead by off duty police officer Ryan Clayburn, who was eating in the diner at the time. The reason this case has come to the BAU is that Gavin was listed as being a runaway/abducted four years earlier, that classification uncertain due to the unreliability of information coming from his single mother. The autopsy showed that Gavin had recently suffered some broken bones in his arms, like someone had bent it, and had powder burn marks on his temples, which they believe was being shot with blanks. The team initially believes the killings to be gang related. Surveillance video shows that Gavin was dropped off outside the diner, who Garcia eventually finds out is seventeen year old Trevor Madison. Trevor was listed as missing less than 24 hour after Gavin four years ago. That information with an attack by Trevor leads the team to believe that the boys were abducted by the unsub who trained/brainwashed them to be his soldiers to carry out whatever his mission, and that there are probably other boys that he has abducted to be his brainwashed soldiers. As the team tries to determine the identities of possible other soldiers, they come across some information which leads them to the identity of the unsub. Locating him before he carries out his grand mission, or before he abducts more soldiers if the mission fails, may however be more difficult.	 When Clive Trevelyan - Member of Parliament, war hero and heir apparent to Prime Minister Winston Churchill- is killed, Miss Marple sets about to solve the case.

There are several possible suspects including Trevelyan's ward, James Pearson and his fiancée Emily Trefusis; his political agent, John Enderby; a journalist Charles Burnaby; a visiting American Martin Zimmerman; and several other apparently disinterested parties. A convict has also escaped from Dartmoor prison. Miss Marple concludes that Trevalyan's murder is related to his days in Egypt and sets about to identify the murderer. With Sir Winston Churchill ailing and set to step down as English Prime Minister, Clive Trevalyn looks set to become the next PM. A popular war hero who made his initial fame and fortune as an explorer and archaeologist in Egypt, he seems to have the world at his feet.

Luckily Miss Marple is on hand to solve the mystery. Heavy snow is falling in Dartmoor and the shadowy guests in the local hotel decide to take part in a séance in order to amuse themselves. But the evening takes on a more sinister edge when the table-turning suggests Trevelyan, an infamous local, is in danger. Meanwhile at Sittaford house Miss Marple finds a death threat sent to Trevelyan. Enderby, Trevelyan's loyal right hand man, is so concerned for his friend's safety that he wants to check on him.

The only surgeon capable of performing such a delicate operation would be Dr. Uri Dutrov,but he is retired and living in Moscow,where Stewart goes to interview him. Jason,however,flies South to Istanbul to uncover the real truth behind the perfect operation.	 When a "chosen" boy found on planet Abydos is brought to SGC, he sends a telepathic message, causing Daniel Jackson's personality to undergo disturbing changes. Will the rest of SG-1 be able to solve the mystery of the boy's origin before he becomes a power-hungry warmonger? When a young boy, Shifu, is found on Abydos he is taken to SGC. The boy may have special powers and may in fact be the child they spirited away several years ago to keep him away from from the Goa'uld. Daniel and the boy develop a rapport and the boy embeds information in Daniel's mind. The information proves invaluable as Daniel now has the blueprint for a defense system - a ring of satellites circling the Earth - that would repel any Goa'uld attack. As the system is being built Daniel undergoes a dramatic personality change becoming demanding, impatient and at times, imperious. His mania knows no bounds but all is not as it seems. The SG-1 is summoned by Kasuf to investigate a mysterious phenomenon in Abydos and they find the boy Shifu. He tells that he is Harcesis and he might be Sha're's son. Daniel has a close contact with the boy and they decide to take Shifu to be examined at the SGC. Daniel explains to Shifu that they want to check whether he has knowledge of the Goa'uld science and Shifu makes telepathic contact with him. Soon Daniel learns the Goa'uld technological knowledge and he changes his personality, affecting the SG-1. When Daniel's Harsesis son Shifu '(light') is finally found on Abydos, and allows SGC to bring him to earth, it proves hard to ascertain his identity and a dilemma arises if the boy should be made to activate his Goa'uld knowledge and thus be exposed to its horror, as all where apparently blocked out by Ooma to allow him a normal youth and wise education. Daniel isn't just affected emotionally, after a philosophical interview and a touch of his forehead he wakes up realizing he's the new vessel of the Harsesis heritage. His character and attitude soon change from inquisitive team player to overbearing leader; he soon comes up with an $80 billion plan for a satellite defense system against the Goa'uld or any other threat and gets the Pentagon's blank check to execute it like a proconsul, cutting off even his SG-1 colleagues, and worse follows after a year.

Jessica's friend Imogene Shaughnessy was about to buy Deauville's house so Jessica thinks it's highly unlikely that she she would take her own life. Blackmail is at the root of it all and Jessica manages to identify the killer responsible for both murders.	 The killer: Stuart Fletcher, a paramedic. The victim: Graeme Jenkins, who died in a skydiving accident when his parachute did not open as the cords were cut on both chutes. After the autopsy, Betty determines that Jenkins would have soon died anyway as he was in the later stages of terminal lung cancer, leading to the initial possible belief that he committed suicide. Graeme's wife, Ingrid Jenkins, is able to confirm Graeme was going through an ordered bucket list, skydiving only the most recent activity, but as his life insurance policy did cover his death by cancer that there was no reason why he would have wanted to end his life prematurely via suicide. A chance statement by Graeme prior to the jump about his lucky number leads to a series of clues as to at least a visual identification of the possible killer, who seems to be using the assumed name of John Turner. Connecting John to Stuart is a little more difficult as is figuring out motive. If they are able to make a connection, they will find a first responder who is suffering from PTSD specifically regarding a misdiagnosis leading to an unwanted outcome.

Later, a cabbie tips them on what he thinks is a burglary in progress. They get a hit on prints taken at the pawn shop the night before and find the suspect working at a car wash. He tries for a clean getaway, but pulls a gun instead and is caught. After nightfall they back up Wells and Brady again, on a prowler call this time, where the homeowner takes a shot at a suspected prowler. Malloy and Reed's latest calls deal largely with ordinary citizens owning guns, and what can and does often go wrong, especially if those gun owners don't know the law.

They then are called to a robbery at a pawn shop, where the robber used the shop owner's gun against him. Malloy and Reed will hope that ident can recover evidence at the scene for them to apprehend the robber. They are then off to the shooting range for recertification, but not before Wells teaches his wife's female cousin to shoot, she who just bought a gun which is something she thought she'd never do. Next, they get a call about a man trying to break into an apartment building by scaling the side of it. They will learn from the man that he has other reasons for scaling the wall than to steal. Their last call late at night takes them to a residential prowler case, which has the potential to go terribly wrong because of the homeowner and his gun. Malloy and Reed encounter Wells and his latest partner Brady through many of these calls, the two who openly and publicly feud with each other about police procedure. The question becomes if there is anything that can be done to mend their rift. If not, Brady may have to resort to requesting a new partner, which will mean that Wells will have had six different partners in a three year time span.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
