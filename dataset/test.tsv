33987_76128	 Thugs break into the heavily-guarded art room of a multimillionaire and steal a Gauguin painting worth a fortune. When Five-O comes to investigate, the millionaire, his secretary and his grandson (who are the only inhabitants of the mansion) are surprisingly uncooperative. It turns out that the old man had been planning to sell the painting and had hired two art appraisers to market it. Soon, the group receives a ransom demand. The grandson figures out a way to pay the ransom despite intense Five-O surveillance -- with grandfather, grandson and secretary all leaving to "drop off" the $250,000, leading Five-O members on a wild goose chase, and arriving at the Iolani Palace at the exact same moment. The art appraiser, who wasn't under surveillance, paid the money and got the painting back himself. This bit of mass nose-thumbing really doesn't go over well with McGarrett, who suspects the grandson of stealing the painting to get the ransom money for his own lavish lifestyle. All is not what it seems, however. When the appraisers look over the returned painting and pronounce it genuine, the grandson promptly says it's a fake. How does he know? In a roughhousing bout with a buddy, he fell onto the real painting and damaged it. That means the real painting was stolen long before; the burglary was an elaborate scheme to steal a forgery. The grandson figures out immediately who was behind the theft of the painting (and the ransom money, presumably split among the thieves and their hired burglars), but is murdered before he can tell Five-O. McGarrett knows the appraisers did the dirty work, but has no way of charging them unless somehow he can find the real painting in their hands.	 A suspected jewel robber, his ex-girl-friend and a cop who became more than friends with her are all killed by a sniper, who turns out to be a sixteen-year-old boy.

Pontus risks his life in pursuit of the murderer for which he is initially rebuked by Wallander for not being a team player and endangering his colleagues though Wallander comes to see the young man's bravery. Pontus also holds out against his estranged father who has come to persuade him to join the family law firm,using Pontus's illegitimate son as the lure. Pontus resists but for the first time begins to bond with the child.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

Jack O'Neill can't quite understand why the General quit and so visits him at home where he learns the truth: he was forced to resign by the secretive NID, who had threatened to harm his grandchildren. Jack sets out to make things right and enlists the help of the imprisoned Harry Maybourne. A visit to Senator Robert Kinsey starts to unravel the mystery. At SGC meanwhile, General Bauer makes a decision that could prove fatal. When General Hammond suddenly retires from the SGC, the arrogant General Bauer assumes the command. His first action is to split the SG-1: Daniel and Sam are assigned scientists, Teal'c is sent to join the SG-3 and Jack is put away. Jack visits General Hammond expecting to convince him to return to the SGC and he learns that his granddaughters have threatened his granddaughter to force him to quit the SGC. Soon Jack finds that the eminence grise is Senator Robert Kinsey that has sent the NID to force the renounce of Hammond. Further, Jack depends on the traitor Maybourne to stop Kinsey. Meanwhile Sam is forced to develop a powerful naquadah bomb and Bauer wants to use it to destroy an entire planet.	-1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Devalos invites her to court and gets the sentence he wanted - death by lethal injection. Allison continues dreaming however and she now fears that the wrong man may have convicted.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	1	0	0

They don't even seem to want to let the team know that they know each other, which may be difficult to hide amongst a group of profilers. Cruz wants to accompany the team into the field on their next case, which takes them to Baltimore, Maryland, where a young John Doe was found stumbling around a warehouse district. Alive, he has ligature marks on his wrists, and drill marks in the corner of his eyes which they determine was a just performed lobotomy. He ends up paralyzed without the ability to speak, but his mental faculties seem to be in tact. Through what slow communication Morgan is able to do with him, Morgan learns that the unsub is white male that the victim did now know, and that there was a female victim as well, who is probably still captive. The team believes the unsub held him captive in one of the nearby warehouses, and that he let him go purposefully. This M.O. does not seem to match with the fact of choosing as the victim who the team believes travels in a circle where he would not be soon missed. When a further medical examination is done on the victim, they learn the purpose for letting him go: a microscopic camera was inserted in his eye, meaning that the unsub has been watching everything going on. Through this technology, the team is able to communicate to the unsub, who takes more direct measures in showing the team what he is up to. The key to finding who the unsub is still rests with identifying the victim, and tying him to a similar case that occurred recently in Berlin, Germany.

Kevin is reluctant to introduce his artist girlfriend Julie to his uptight and judgmental parents, but she takes that the wrong way and decides they're not meant to be together. He goes walking in the woods alone, and is thirsty enough to drink water falling from the pot of a statue of a woman. He feels sick afterward, and Julie and their friends don't see him return. The next day a strange professor approaches Julie and claims he knows where Kevin is, then leads her to a stone statue that looks like him, claiming Kevin turned into it. Julie doesn't believe it at first, but then meets the statue's creator, Vivian White. It turns out that the statue was based on a Greek myth about a star-crossed couple who chose to turn to stone and always be together, and there was never water in the bucket that the statue had been holding before. They learn that the statue has been divided in half, with a male subject detached from it, so the woman probably released water like tears and transformed Kevin. The only problem is, they have to get a hold of the other half of the statue to turn him back.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	-1	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

After Ultra Magnus questioned if he's staying too, Prime agreed, because he told that Interstellar is the last of the moons running on what Energon is left in their world and he needs him and Grimlock to stay and protect the moon of what Decepticons are left there; Magnus understands but tells Prime in agreement, that the two will have to leave when all the Energon is gone.

The team profiles the Tommy Killer, who rapes and murders women forced to watch him in upper class houses, where he destroys status symbols. As soon as the press notices that detail, he makes a habit of quoting 17th century poetic ballads on Death conversing with its victims. They are confident enough about their profile of a resentful, skilled white middle class man to rule out a less well-organized black attacker but arrest the suspect to make Tommy manifest himself, alas by an untraceable phone call- which precisely provides a crucial clue. The BAU is called to San Diego, California where a serial rapist/murderer is on the loose. The media has coined the killer, who targets upper middle class white women in their own home in the middle of the day, the Tommy Killer - as in 'The Who' (qv)'s rock opera - since he glues their eyes wide open so that they are forced to watch their rape happening. In the last three incidents, the unsub has been scrawling partial verse from a 17th century ballad at the crime scene. The text is a discussion between women and death, the scrawled text only being the death's side of the conversation. The BAU has a profile but no solid leads. When what the BAU believes is a failed rape attempt by a copycat, the BAU now has a way to get the real Tommy Killer to show himself to them. Through this, Gideon discovers some unexpected information to assist in the case. Meanwhile, it's Reid's 24th birthday.

Nami and Nojiko ran towards their home, only to be stop by the town doctor who tells them that they need to escape while they can, before Arlong discovers them to be the foster daughters of Bellemere. Bellemere thinks she has the whole thing taken care of only when Arlong bite and damaged the barrel of the gun. Then he continuously stomp on Bellemere's arm demanding her to pay for her soul. Arlong presumed that a family lived in this home. But one of his mermen looked at the stolen town records that Bellemere was never married or had any children. Gen came to tell them that she lives by herself and will pay the fine. Arlong leaved only when Bellemere announced that she has 2 foster children. And will use her money for their lives instead of hers. Nami and Nojiko came running towards her and begged her not to do it. But she's made up her mind and she doesn't want her only family to be killed at all. She told them to live on and stay strong. Nami didn't want her to die, not when she's yet to make her map of the world. Bellemere told her that that's her goal to fulfill. Arlong now knows the whole truth and will gladly kill Bellemere instead. Gen tries to stop him, but got injured by one of the mermen. Then all of Cocoyashi's locals came in a rampage to stop them from harming Bellemere. Arlong told his crew to fight them off but not to kill. He'll kill Bellemere as an example to those who don't have money. Her last words to Nojiko and Nami were "I love you". And she was shot by Arlong in front of their eyes. All the villagers were feeling guilty for not saving a friend of theirs. Arlong felt great after killing Bellemere told them all that, that's a prime example to those who refuse to pay their monthly fees. The crew found Nami's drawn map in Bellemere's back pocket. Nami told her to give it back. Which made Arlong amazed that a girl like Nami can draw up a map that good. So he takes Nami with them by force as she'll be useful to them. Gen tried to stop them but he was in no condition to fight at all. The once peaceful town was trashed and all the boats were destroyed by the mermen. Escaping is futile and not even the marines or government can help them now. Gen, Nojiko, and the villagers were worried about what will become of Nami. Then Nami came to the village with some money in her hands. They were all glad that she was safe. But they noticed that she has some bruises and she announced that she joined them as their navigator to draw maps. They all couldn't believe it, not even Nojiko who tried to tell her that she's with the one who killed their mother. But Nami said that they'll let her live, because she's being paid for making maps. When she turned around they noticed Arlong's symbol was on her left arm. Which means she's part of their crew now. Gen couldn't bare to look at her. And told her to leave the village, and she did. Later that night Nojiko finds Nami visiting Bellemere's newly buried grave. She told Nojiko that she'll save up 100 million to buy the village back from Arlong. That way everyone of the village will be free again. She must do it on her own, and advice both Nojiko and the villagers to not help, because Arlong will know. And over the years she became a pirate thief so she can steal even more money. Nami placed all that stolen treasure in a secret spot near Bellemere's home. And will use it until she has enough. After hearing the story both Usopp and Sanji are stun by the tale. Nojiko said that she's worked so hard to receive that must money. And if the Straw Hat Pirates keep claiming to be her friend, then she'll lose loyalty to Arlong and her plan will be ruined. Which is why they shouldn't interfere at all. It's too much for a girl to be working for the one who killed her own foster mother. In the bushes Johnny and Yosaku, who didn't left the island heard the whole thing and felt terrible for what they've said about Nami. Nami got up from her seat at Bellemere's house and mentions that she only need 7 million to buy back the village. But will her 8 year plan succeed?	1	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Introducing the city through narration, Booger reminisces about how wonderful Mixopolis is, showing how integral Mixing is to the community, through two neighbors, Sharx taking photos with tourists, Surgeo performing a medical procedure, and two teams of Kraws and Krogs. However, Booger notices that things have been changing, and Mixels have no longer wanted to mix with each other lately; showing off a ruder personality towards each other as the colors of the city start to fade. Screeno is also one of the few that is disgusted by this depressing news. Booger notes how the city has gotten fairly bleak, but he knows that somewhere out there is someone that can help. During a past bank heist of Brohawk and Punkchure, the two of them find themselves face to face with the Nindjas; the protectors of Mixopolis. As they Max and foil the two robbers, Mysto heeds the call for all Mixels to keep the balance of mixing alive in Mixopolis as the Nindjas disappear into the night. This is later revealed to be a comic book being read by Booger to his friends Zabo, Blip and Scrud. While Booger is adamant that the Nindjas are real and will return again, his friends are not as sure. While trying to convince them, Booger and his friends encounter two Nixels putting up negative posters for a new product, noting how the negativity is spreading throughout the town. During this, a fire in an apartment building has started, leaving a Mixie Cat trapped in the flames. As the MCFD are adamant about not mixing with each other, the Nindjas appear and save the Mixie Cat, with only Booger seeing it happen. Hoards of Nixels stay and laugh at the destruction and chaos as the building burns to the ground. While the Nindjas question why the MCFD were so against mixing, Booger notices the swarms of Nixels and swears he has seen them before. At the same time, Mysto pulls out a memory of a past encounter with the Nixels; specifically a battle with King Nixel, which means he is somewhere in the city. Meanwhile, Major Nixel announces to King Nixel that the Nixels have infiltrated Mixopolis, which King Nixel wishes to make his own, through a product he calls the I-Cubit, which promotes conflict over creativity. With new devices, Major Nixel is able to convince nearly all of the Mixels to trade in their old Cubits for the new ones, which quickly drains them of color and enthusiasm and transforms them into Nixel-like zombies. Despite the fact that his friends want to trade their old Cubits in, Booger is adamant to keep onto the one that they have. When Major Nixel comments to King Nixel about how this remaining Cubit could cause problems with the scheme, King Nixel dismisses him, and sends his hoards of Nixels out into the streets, as they reign chaos, fully turning the now-helpless Mixels into Nixel-like zombies. The Nixels continue to run rampant, causing the Newzers to run from the scene of their broadcast. The four kids try to hide in an alleyway. A truck containing the Cubit essence is soon followed by the Nixels. Nearby, Booger remembers these creatures from an issue of The Nindja Chronicles, but was unable to figure out how the Nindjas won thanks to the next issue being a rare one. However, he still gets an idea on how to infiltrate their base. Meanwhile, the Nindjas figure out that the Nixels are the culprits behind the I-Cubit scheme, and follow them into their headquarters; only to be ambushed by a large swarm. As Screeno and the other Newzers find a hidden location to stay reporting (revealed to be Gobbol), the kids, now wearing cardboard boxes, plan to infiltrate the building as well. Seeing them do this, Screeno has the other Newzers follow them. After besting the guards, the kids manage to locate King Nixel. As the Newzers are unable to get past the guards, they enlist the help of Camsta to get them up to the top floor. Camsta then films King Nixel insulting the Mixels and broadcasts the footage to Mixopolis Stadium, which only slightly delays the King's plans to completely zombie-like the remaining Mixels. As King Nixel enacts phase three of his plan, Booger reveals himself to King Nixel and boasts that the Nindjas will be able to defeat him, while King Nixel reveals he has had the three of them "Nixelized". As he explains how he has loaded all of the Cubit essence into a large missile that he plans to have destroyed, he sends out the zombies to back the kids in the corner, with a chance of falling to their demise. Through a coordinated group dance, the kids are able to free the Nindjas, along with a few other Mixels, from their zombie state, though the missile is still set to go off. As the Nindjas face off with the Nixel amalgamate again, Booger replaces the control I-Cubit with his rainbow one. Despite his efforts, King Nixel traps Booger inside the missile, which launches off into the air. However, thanks to Booger being inside it, he causes it to malfunction; spreading the Cubit essence across Mixopolis and restoring the city back to normal. Major Nixel ends up fleeing, and King Nixel gets 'Mixelized' and then incinerated by a Mix, while the Mixels celebrate. However, as the others mourn the apparent demise of Booger, he parachutes down to cheers and praise. The Nindjas gift Booger with the rare issue of their comic, with an addendum of him saving the day. The Trashoz sweep up any remaining Nixels, Screeno caps off with how Booger saved the day, and Booger narrates on how Mixopolis will always be his town.	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

34474_76939	 Nueno Meisuke, known to his students as "Nube" is a teacher/exorcist who finds that his new school is home to a huge variety of supernatural disturbances. Nube has a demon he trapped in his hand from a battle when he was younger. This demon hand allows him to communicate with ghosts and spirits and dispatch them if necessary. However, there are risks, as Nube must balance using the power of the demon but not being consumed by it. Some of these "yokai" (spirits, demons, etc., many of which are taken from Japanese folklore or urban legend) are drawn to the school by him, as he has crossed paths with many spirits and demons in his career as an exorcist. Among them is Yukime, a snow/cold spirit who has an unrequited love for Nube, which leads to many comedic and touching moments. This show has many comedic elements, as the students and staff of the school are a quite a bunch of varied characters, and Nube himself is sort of a good-natured, clownish klutz when not fighting demons and so forth, and his interactions provide many humorous moments. He is something of a lecher towards his co-worker Ruriko, who is afraid of all things supernatural. This leads to many classic comedic slapstick situations or misunderstandings. However, the show is equally, if not more so, horror-related, as many demons, ghosts, spirits, etc. cross paths with Nube, the staff, and children, some friendly, well-meaning, or otherwise harmless, but many malicious and evil; Nube must dispatch these threats to himself, his students, and others.

In Baltimore, Maryland, John Summers is found dead, he who was tortured by at least two people before being murdered. After finding the body, the CIA made his death look like a suicide.

52528_98683	 Adrian Carsini is a fanatical wine connoisseur who operates an elite winery on the California coast. When Adrian's indifferent brother, who owns the winery property, threatens to sell it, Adrian bludgeons him in a fit of rage, then binds and places his brother in his air-tight wine vault while he travels to New York to attend a conference. Adrian disposes of the body on his return in such a way as to make his brother's demise look like a scuba diving accident, but Adrian hadn't reckoned on the canny Lieutenant Columbo from LAPD's Homicide Division (a cigar-smoking detective with many fetishes: a constantly referred-to but unseen wife, an old car, and a rumpled raincoat). In his usual patronizing manner, Columbo suspects Carsini almost immediately, befriending him while slyly searching for clues to link Carsini to the killing. Adrian Carsini runs a California winery owned by his younger half-brother who reveals he's about to sell it. This enrages the older wine connoisseur who knocks the young playboy out cold and ties him up in the wine cellar. Soon Carsini has committed a murder and makes it look like a scuba diving accident. The rumpled Lt. Columbo is on the case and is willing to harass everyone - even Carsini's cold but devoted secretary - until he's discovered the truth. Wine lover Adrian Carsini, who runs the family wine business, is so highly regarded that he is about to be named the industry's Man-of-the-Year. When his 29-year-old half-brother Ric - who loves to have a good time and will soon be getting married - tells him he is going to sell the family business to get his hands on some cash, Adrian kills him, coolly making Rick's death look like a scuba diving accident. By the time Lt. Colombo gets involved in the case, he had already been approached by the dead man's concerned girlfriend, Joan Stacey, over Rick's absence. The medical examiner estimates he suffocated some 6 days ago, which puzzles Colombo since, if that's correct, the weather on the day he died was such that it's unlikely he would have gone diving. He also doesn't understand why Rick's fancy sports car - a convertible - was left with the top down if it was raining. Colombo soon suspects Adrian Carsini of the murder and sets a trap for him. Adrian Carsini is an oenophile who runs his family's vineyard and is obsessed of making the perfect wine instead of making money. His half-brother, Rick only wants to spend money on various hobbies and interests like sports and fast cars. He's also been married several times. He informs Adrian that he plans to sell the vineyard which he owns to some wine merchants whom Adrian thinks makes inferior wines. Adrian then knocks him out and locks him in his wine vault and turns off the ventilation so that he would have no air to breathe. He would go to New York on a trip and when he returns he makes in appear that his brother died as a result of a scuba diving accident. Rick's girlfriend who was waiting for him goes to the police to file a report but no one's around so she goes to Columbo who's reluctant to take it because missing person is not his purview. When he gets word that Carsini's been found and his death is not ruled an accident he investigates and talks to the man's brother and can't help but think something's odd about his reaction to his brother's death.	 An extremely violent episode in which two seriously loco mobsters wage war on each other, with Danny's photographer girlfriend -- who snapped a picture of one of the two sneaking back into the Islands -- caught in the middle. The only show for which Seth Sakai received guest-star credit (he plays the second mobster, who snaps his fingers to get ice cream literally on call) is the one that debuts his shaved head (it was filmed after "Target: A Cop"); he would use the cue-ball look for the rest of the series.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

Soon, e-mails are sent out to every newspaper about the nasty situation that the police had tried to keep secret. Will the police ever overcome the "Monster"?	 Jessica's fund-raising dinner for veterans is tonight, with Brody making a speech and with her also in full view of D.C. high society. With tension between them early that afternoon, is a reconciliation at hand? Then Brody gets a call from Roya, sending him to Pennsylvania. As the afternoon wanes, Jessica calls him and he makes up stories. Will he get to the dinner in time? Carrie works on her report through the night and looks forward to the debrief at Langley at 6:00 PM. How will she respond to a fresh discovery of how the CIA values her? Brody grudgingly follows instructions via Roya Hammad to bring the Syrian tailor, who supplied his bomb suit and is about to be arrested by the CIA, from his Gettysburg home to a country safe-house. The man fears being eliminated and tries to knock out Brody to escape, resulting in a fatal fight and woodland burial. The time-consuming escapade prevented Brody from giving the keynote speech at a veterans benefit gala he promised to his wife, who fills in successfully but calls it one set of lies too many when he arrives home. Despite a Lebanese customs official searching his diplomatic luggage, Saul brings home the data card he found in the bag Carrie snatched from Abu Nazir's home office. It contains Brody's 'posthumous' apologetic confession to the USA people. Yet instead of handing it over in Langley, Saul brings it to Carrie, whom the director still won't consider reinstating, so she's stuck in a teaching English to foreigners course. Carrie is feeling energized by the results of the mission in Beirut, as her instincts about the mission ended up being correct, and despite the target, Abu Nazir, not being hit. She is back to her old ways of focusing solely on the CIA work, staying up to all hours of the night preparing the report for the imminent debrief. She even later learns from David that the materials she retrieved from the house in Beirut included some valuable intel, although David and Carrie are yet unaware that those materials also include Brody's confession video, which Saul still has in Beirut. That debrief makes Carrie reevaluate the direction her life is going. Meanwhile, Saul is making his way out of Lebanon, and it is questionable if he will be able to smuggle the video out with him. Elsewhere, Roya informs Brody that the materials that Carrie got from the house in Beirut and which is now in CIA possession may implicate the tailor in Gettysburg. As such, she directs Brody to move the tailor to a safe house immediately. This task places Brody in a difficult position as he is scheduled to speak at Jessica's fundraiser, at which the Vice-President will be introducing him. Brody will have just enough time to get to Gettysburg and transfer the tailor to the safe house and get back to make his speech if all goes without a hitch. However, any delay in the proceedings would jeopardize his ability to make it back in time, which in turn would further place his and Jessica's relationship on rocky ground. Fresh from her adventures in Beirut, a restless Carrie prepares for what she hopes will be a triumphant return to the CIA. Meanwhile, Brody learns that the Gettysburg bomb maker is on a terrorist watch list and in danger of imminent discovery. With no time to lose, Brody attempts a last-minute exfiltration. And Jessica takes risks of her own as she steps into the political limelight.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

One day, Zatch comes home and notices that Kiyo seems a bit different... but he is somehow kinder and friendlier than usual so Zatch happily accepts him! What Zatch doesn't know is that a mamodo kid named Kanchome, has disguised himself as Kiyo and tied Kiyo prisoner to the ceiling!

But the new spell has a strange effect... Kanchome has shrunk! What Kiyo learns from all this is that not all mamodos have come to the human world in search of power and evil...some of them, like Kanchome and Zatch, have come to grow stronger and to learn to believe in themselves.	1	0	-1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0

When three bodies are found with animal and human bite marks in a shallow grave near Milwaukee, the BAU has puzzling questions to answer. Meanwhile, Reid and Garcia work out for a company fitness test, but try to hide their preparation from Morgan. The BAU travels to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where three dead bodies, in various stages of decomposition, are found in a remote location of a nature preserve several hours outside the city, the most recent victim two weeks dead. There are signs that the victims were held captive before being killed. The coroner finds that there are human bite marks made post-mortem on some of the victims. Who is determined as the first victim, Melvin Lewis, seems like the odd victim in that he did not have any human bite marks on him, but his occupation as animal control specialists points Reid to the possibility that the unsub is killing his victims from rabies, first from a wild animal to human, then each human passing it along to the next victim. The coroner confirms the assumption. Garcia is able to cross reference past rabies cases in the area to people who work in the animal control business, which may provide the identity of the unsub. The reason for the unsub's need to watch his victims die of rabies and where the unsub is keeping his prisoners will take further digging. Regardless, the team needs to be hyper-vigilant if only because of the crazed nature of any others in captivity. Meanwhile, Reid and Garcia don't want to let anyone know, especially athletic Morgan, that they are training for their upcoming mandatory fit test.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

22751_69618	 Saunders, Caje, and Kirby are on a night mission moving through an abandoned French village when they notice an American paratrooper hanging from the church steeple in his entangled parachute - and the paratrooper is still alive. Immediately after they enter the church to rescue the paratrooper, two German trucks full of troops enter the village, stop just outside the church, and set up an armed perimeter with the apparent intention of establishing a command post. Saunders and his men ascend the steeple steps with the hope of rescuing the paratrooper under the cover of darkness and before the Germans take notice of him. The paratrooper's helmet falls to the ground attracting the Germans' attention, and they shine a spotlight on him. Saunders had already told the paratrooper to play dead. Even with the spotlight on him, he certainly looks dead as he dangles limply in his harness. Assuming he is dead, the Germans forget him for the rest of the night. Daylight comes and Saunders is still trying to figure a way to get the paratrooper inside the steeple and back to safety without being seen by the Germans below. Then a German soldier on the ground looks up and notices the "dead" paratrooper is wearing some very nice new boots, and he considers his own boots which are virtually worn out. Wanting some new boots, the German decides to go up the steeple to pull the paratrooper inside and take the boots for himself. Saunders kills the German with a bayonet as he arrives on the steeple bell level, dons the German's uniform, and then proceeds to pull the "dead" paratrooper inside. The other Germans on the ground cheer him on thinking Saunders is their comrade. They do manage to rescue the paratrooper who turns out to be an Army Captain who was on a commando mission that also played a key part of this episode, but the rescue was not completed until after Saunders and his men are involved in a firefight as they withdraw from the village.	 General MacArthur is visiting everyone in the Pacific and Boyington's men are his next stop.

51847_64913	 A Dutch soldier in the 1600's saves the life of a native woman and is granted the power of eternal youth in return. In the 2000's he is a police detective in New York City, and after 400 years, knows just about everything about the way the criminal mind works.

At this point he will age normally and die eventually. In modern New York, John is a police detective who has a few people close to him that know his secret (old friends, literally) and tends to run into people who think they remember him from their own past.

Toby shares what he knows with Detective Charlie Marks (Lisa Marcos) and they discover that despite spending 14 years in prison, Ron may not have committed the crime.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

227_116830	 Audrey McMurray, a rally driver and property owner, may appear to be a philanthropist but her ruthless treatment of her tenants has caused Harriet Welsby's husband to kill himself whilst she openly cheats on her husband Walter with young mechanic Gary Bakewell. Audrey is killed in a hill climb after somebody tampers with her car's brakes and Harriet is arrested after threatening her. Then Gary confesses but Father Brown is convinced that Walter and his wife's secretary Phyllis, who are lovers, are the culprits though he has difficulty in persuading Sullivan to let him ensure that justice is done.

The M.E. is able to determine that the markings were made with the same pen. The death of the first victim, a model suburban soccer mom, was initially ruled a suicide from an overdose of sleeping pills, her own prescription. The second victim, a homeless man, died of a heroin overdose, he who was known not to be a drug user, but rather an advocate for the homeless to get those in need into drug rehab programs.

The identification of the ink markings in relation to the aspect of the disturbed ground may provide the key to finding where the unsub will strike next.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

44797_62526	 In a show with several similarities to the previous season opener, a series of swindlings are covers for serial murder. An Army sergeant who lost his brother in Vietnam because of the latter's infatuation with a bar girl, uses Honolulu bar girls as patsies to "marry" dead soldiers and collect on their $10,000 apiece insurance policies -- then murders them and keeps the money. The sergeant is absolutely coldblooded and utters the episode's title when his partner (who has been forging the marriage certificates and the insurance papers) has a heart attack and can't get to his nitro tablets. An unusually violent ending. From this point, all series closing credits are played over shots of men paddling an outrigger canoe through the ocean (replacing the first-season end title of a flashing police light on a car driving through Honolulu); the color and size of the credit cards is also altered.

However, a second victim family, the Zumwalts, is discovered. The early teen daughter Josie Zumwalt has been abducted from the home, father Luke Zumwalt dead on site with the ritual with the eyes and the throat slashed, but mother Ellie Zumwalt who survived the ordeal, albeit with the ritual of the eyes also conducted on her. The team find that a key piece of evidence at both sites is a custom made hourglass, with the sand used both in the hourglasses and placed into the eyes important. Ellie Zumwalt surviving may also provide some evidence both if her survival was on purpose or by accident, and what information she can provide about the unsub. That information makes the team's work time sensitive as they know they have only a certain amount of time before the unsub will kill Josie. This case proves difficult for Morgan who isn't sure if it is anything beyond being off work for six months.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

Mike decides to go undercover as new employee Mike Long to discover the cause of these incidents. He is taking this approach in large part to prove to himself that he can make it on his own without Nikki and/or Duke's help. This undercover work includes boarding in Ray's old room at the rooming house of Emma Brinkley, who, beyond her own family, solely houses people with physical disabilities, including Harper employees. Mike learns that the disabled employees are concerned for their livelihood as they believe that they are seen as the reason for the problems, which could result in the cancellation of the program.

Mike's life could go the same way as Ray's if the culprits learn Mike's true identity. But some information Mike receives from Nikki may help in identifying at least one of the culprits without their knowledge.	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

31437_36732	 The officers are in a driver refresher course where their driving skills are honed and tested. The department wants to prevent patrol car accidents. Officer Wells has proposed a new strategy to deal with the theft of car accessories that they put into action on their return to duty. They ride bicycles as paperboys to prevent the thieves hiding from the police on patrol by laying down on the sidewalk side of the car. Malloy encounters an irate customer thinking he is her paperboy but the strategy works. However, Officer Wells wrecks his bicycle and has to explain it to the little girl who owns it. Reed hounds Malloy to drive now that they have gone through driving school but Malloy won't give up the wheel. They pull over a man in a VW bus who rails on the police tactics. However, he is carrying a parrot that says "Down with the pigs." Malloy gives the man a warning and both officers have a laugh about it. A call to a break-in at an auto dealership leads to a high speed chase. Malloy backs off on the chase when they think the man is cornered but the man wraps the car around a tree. Malloy and Reed are two of several officers in for a driver's refresher course, which they both pass with flying colors. Because of his performance, Reed wants more opportunity to drive while on patrol. Reed's performance is important as he has made a bet with Wells about their respective outcomes. While there, Wells tells Malloy that he has made a proposal to brass about how to combat the rash of "vehicle strippings" i.e. thefts of items such as car stereos. However Wells won't divulge the proposal to Malloy. Reed driving will have to wait as Malloy and Reed do find out about Wells' approved proposal, with Malloy and Reed included on the first shift of its implementation: bike patrols in the middle of the night, those patrols masquerading as newspaper boys. Wells' proposal ends up having two unexpected consequences. On their regular patrol with Malloy not relinquishing the steering wheel, Adam-12 stops a "hippie" vehicle for a minor traffic violation, its driver who is hypocritical in his approach to the officers. And while checking out a robbery in progress, they end up in a high speed pursuit which will really test if Malloy was paying attention in the driver's course.

Not knowing what to make of the letter, the young couple eventually decide to pay Laura a visit in order to see for themselves what is really going on at the house. When they arrive, Elinor immediately becomes suspicious towards Mary Gerrard, the lodge keeper's daughter, recently returned to England after having studied in Europe and whom everyone else at the house seem to absolutely dote on. No one else however seem to share Elinor's suspicions or dislike of the young woman, and in particular not Roddy, whom Elinor one night discovers kissing Mary Gerrard in her aunt's drawing room. When Mary suddenly turns up dead, poisoned by a salmon sandwich, Elinor's dislike of Mary makes her the obvious suspect and hardly has time to take in what has happened before she finds herself on trial and condemned for murder.

Elinor Carlisle stands in the dock, accused of murder. The case against her is strong. Only Elinor seems to have motive to murder her ailing aunt, whose fortune Elinor inherited, and the beautiful Mary Gerrard, who broke Elinor's heart when she seduced her beloved fianc√© Roddy Winter away from her. Only the devoted Peter Lord, the doctor who tended her aunt and who has long loved her from afar, believes in her innocence, and all would appear lost - but Peter Lord is good friends with Hercule Poirot, the brilliant detective. And there is something about the seemingly open-and-shut case that troubles Poirot.	 The son of an Arab King is kidnapped while they're on his private plane while in flight.

19868_63819	 After a violent shipwreck, billionaire playboy Oliver Queen was missing and presumed dead for five years before being discovered alive on a remote island in the Pacific. When he returns home to Starling City, his devoted mother Moira, much-beloved sister Thea, and best friend Tommy welcome him home, but they sense Oliver has been changed by his ordeal on the island. While Oliver hides the truth about the man he's become, he desperately wants to make amends for the actions he took as the boy he was. Most particularly, he seeks reconciliation with his former girlfriend, Laurel Lance. As Oliver reconnects with those closest to him, he secretly creates the persona of Arrow - a vigilante - to right the wrongs of his family, fight the ills of society, and restore Starling City to its former glory. By day, Oliver plays the role of a wealthy, carefree and careless philanderer he used to be - flanked by his devoted chauffeur/bodyguard, John Diggle - while carefully concealing the secret identity he turns to under cover of darkness. However, Laurel's father, Detective Quentin Lance, is determined to arrest the vigilante operating in his city. Meanwhile, Oliver's own mother, Moira, knows much more about the deadly shipwreck than she has let on - and is more ruthless than he could ever imagine. Five years after everyone believed Oliver Queen died in boating accident, he is found alive and well by fisherman on an island in the South China Sea. His father Robert Queen was a billionaire and Oliver's rescue makes international headlines. He is welcomed home by his mother Moira, her new husband Walter Steele and his sister Thea. Oliver is quite fit and learned to survive on his private island and those skills will come in handy as he resettles into his old life. His father shared secrets with him and he is kidnapped by someone who wants to know what his father told him. He escapes and in his alternate persona, Arrow, begins to learn what has happened during the years he was away.	 When a wealthy winegrower disappears, the three private investigators go undercover at the vineyard to track down the whereabouts of the body. If the body doesn't turn up in a certain amount of time, the inheritance will be presented to the man's second wife, Rachel, instead of his long-lost daughter, Janet. Beautiful Sabrina Duncan, Jill Munroe and Kelly Garrett, attended the Los Angeles Police Academy, and upon graduation were each given menial jobs in the force. To get them away from that life, the mysterious and very private Charles Townsend, who owns a private investigation agency, hired the three to work for him, along with officious Scott Woodville, and slightly bumbling John Bosley, who is generally relegated to tasks at the office. Charlie calls the three women his "angels". The issue is that none of them, except Woodville, have ever met Charlie, who conducts his business with them via telephone. All they know about Charlie is that he is rich, has his own bevy of beautiful women in his private life, and will protect them with every fiber of his being. The next case which Charlie sends his team on for a client he does not specify is the disappearance of wealthy California vintner Vincent LeMaire. On the seventh anniversary of his disappearance this upcoming Saturday, he will be declared legally dead, at which time, his vast estate, most specifically 15,000 acre Samarra - the vineyard which includes its lavish mansion - will go to his second wife, Rachel LeMaire. Their task is not only to find out what happened to LeMaire, but to locate his presumed dead body to implicate his killers. They are fairly certain that Rachel and Beau Creel, who has worked his way from a farm hand to manager of the vineyard and Rachel's bedroom, killed LeMaire, and that his body is probably somewhere in the large swamp on the property. The angels' plan is for one of them to masquerade as Janet LeMaire, Vincent LeMaire and his long deceased first wife's long missing daughter who has come back to reclaim her inheritance. In carrying out their plan, the angels are aware of the dangers posed by Creel, Rachel and their associates, who have already killed for money. What the angels are unaware of is the dangers of unknown people, most specifically a pickup driving local with a collie who knows the real Janet LeMaire.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Are all three brave enough to throw caution to the wind and pull off a dramatic last second save?	 In a surprising move, Franz von Stresemann abandons the S Orchestra ("S" for "special") that he created, turning it over entirely to Cha Yoo-jin.

Stresemann further makes the campus situation clear by openly announcing that S Orchestra and A Orchestra (the official campus orchestra) will vie against each other at the fall concert for their very existence, setting up tentions between rival orchestra members (elitists vs. leftovers) and between Professors Ahn and Do who have been put in charge.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Due to a computer error, NASA's space shuttle that was launched before the apocalypse and was suppose to return to Earth after 30 years of space exploration arrives back 670 years too late.

4346_106913	 The BAU is called to Somerville Academy, a military boys' school, when five students are found dead from hanging while on an unsupervised survival outing in the woods. The school's administration believes it to be a mass suicide as there is a supposed simple suicide note at the scene, with the words "we're sorry". These deaths follow a suicide hanging of another underclassman, Bailey Shelton, two weeks earlier. The one student tying to two sets of deaths together is Josh Redding, who is the missing sixth member of the survival outing, and in whose room Bailey was found hanging.

Unlike his other travels, Karl ends up traveling almost immediately via camel-back to see the main site, the Great Pyramids, due to their close proximity, which ends up being underwhelming if only because of the weather. As he waits for the weather to clear to make another attempt to see the Pyramids, Karl is provided a guide, Achmed, who gives him a lesson in bartering, and takes him to the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities, in which Karl has no interest. So Karl ditches his guide to find some comfort food, which ends up also being an experience to which he is unaccustomed.

Now, the Cylons have evolved into more human form, into machine-created biological beings, who seek to exterminate true biological humans. To this end they use a human scientist, Gaius, to help one of their infiltrators, known as #6, penetrate the Colonies' master defense mainframes; Gaius is reluctant but smitten by #6, a Cylon woman of seemingly insatiable sexual desire, and the result of their affair is a nuclear sneak-attack that obliterates the Colonies and the star navy deployed for their protection.

He's identified as Neil Murray, the owner of an investment company. Maura determines that he suffered a cardiac arrest after being injected with potassium chloride.

Briscoe and Curtis investigate the murder of Ron Harker and his daughter Caitlin. His wife Stephanie was three miles away at the time with her friend Doris Nichols. By the time the police catch up with her, Doris is dead and Stephanie is claiming she was Doris' next victim. They learn however that it was Stephanie who was fooling around and that her husband was about to institute divorce proceedings. She is Canadian however and before they can arrest her, she flees back home. McCoy and ADA Abbie Carmichael come up against the Canadian government which has a policy of not extraditing people to foreign countries where they may face the death penalty. McCoy agrees but as they continue the investigation, they find that she not only hired Nichols to kill her husband but that she killed Ron Harker's first wife. As a result, DA Adam Schiff decides to go after the death penalty. After a family is killed, the blame is put on Doris Nicols. But when she is killed and removed as a suspect to the police, the suspect becomes Stephanie Harker. Ms. Harker, knowing the extradition rules in Canada, flees back to her home in Niagra Falls. The death penalty is not allowed to be put on Harker if she comes back, but after some reasoning, and the fact that she killed her husband's first wife, she is sentenced to death. The Mens Rea in this case is that Stephanie Harker killed her husband due to the fact that he wanted a divorce. The Actus Reas is the actual murders she committed. The Crown argued that she cannot use Canada as a safe haven, and eventually the judge understood.

Colonel Lyle C. Rumford, the proud Commandant of a military academy, is incensed that William Haynes, the owner of the property, wants to turn it into a co-ed college. So, Rumford plots to kill Haynes with a back-firing cannon that Haynes is due to fire in a ceremony. Rumford arranges for the cannon to explode by blocking its discharge with a cleaning rag and thereby making the explosion seem an unfortunate accident caused by a clumsy attendant. Los Angeles Police Department's Lieutenant Columbo comes to the academy to investigate Haynes' death and instantly suspects that Rumford had something to do with the explosion, which Columbo believes was not accidental. Columbo unrelentingly seeks to prove that Rumford had motive and opportunity to rig the cannon. Col. Lyle C. Rumford is commandant of a military academy whose chairman of the board, William Haynes, wants to turn the place co-ed. Haynes, who is the grandson of the academy's founder and was once a cadet under the colonel, has further decided to boot out his hated former commandant. He also insists on firing the ceremonial cannon on Founder's Day, which gives Rumford a devious idea. After an explosion that kills Haynes and looks like an accident caused by a negligent cadet, the rumpled Lt. Columbo is on the case - and he quickly learns this was no accident. When Col. Lyle Mumford learns that William Haynes, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Haynes Military Academy, plans to turn the institution into a co-ed junior college, he has a simple solution - he kills him. For Lt. Columbo however, the evidence indicates that the death was not the unfortunate accident Mumford makes it out to be. Mumford tries to frame one of the under-performing students, Cadet Springer, who not surprisingly denies any knowledge of what has happened.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

ACC Rebecca Fenning puts Dalziel in charge of the case and he would rather be doing almost anything else.

In North Mammon, a close small town, a man abducts three girls who return from the boys football pep rally, and tells them to chose which of them will be killed. Girls soccer player Polly Chambers' mother gets Quantico agent Judy Homefeldt to convince the team to take the case and local Sheriff Yates to officially invite them, but on arrival he states the girls aren't even officially missing, as the mother is an unreliable depression patient. The elaborate preparation, including soothing messages to the parents mentioning Friday, convince the team it's the work of a local, who plausibly plans something relating to the football game, a long-awaited finale. This leaves various suspects to be eliminated, and it looks like the kidnapper planted false forensic material to incriminate innocent men. When Brooke gets sick, the other two decide to sacrifice her- they are given hammers to kill her, then released near the police... A "friend of a friend" of J.J.'s, Judy Homefeldt makes a desperate plea to J.J. to help her find Polly Homefeldt, Brooke Chambers and Kelly Seymour who are Judy's daughter and Polly's best friends living in North Mammon, Pennsylvania. The three are high school seniors, just about to graduate, soccer stars and model students. Judy swears the threesome have been missing for five days, yet the authorities were not convinced that the girls were missing until they discover that the girls left two word-for-word identical and oddly worded telephone messages with their respective parents. Even with this evidence, the local police are still skeptical about the girls being abducted, but based on the telephone messages, the BAU believe that something will happen to the girls in two days, the night of a big championship high school football game. High school football has always been an all consuming passion of the town. The case is difficult for the BAU with which to proceed since North Mammon is a small town where everyone knows everyone, and knowing that one of their own is an abductor would lead to a witch hunt and vigilante-ism. As the case proceeds, the relations of North Mammon residents shows itself not to be as congenial as the residents would like to believe. Meanwhile, the girls are indeed being held against their will, their unknown male captor telling them that they must choose between the three who will die. The girls, who are being deprived of food and water, may end up being easy prey in the unsub's game.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

7273_100087	 Alcee Hastings, is historically, is number 8 of the 15 former federal judges impeached from the federal bench. Hastings represents the very worst in government and his career exemplifies how it truly works and how it should not. No Jurist Doctorate degree required. President Jimmy Carter appointed Hastings to the Southern Florida federal district court in 1979. He was convicted for a variety of crimes and conspiracies in his impeachment trial before the Senate. In their conviction of Hastings, the Senate did not expel him from being able to hold public office as they should have based upon the bribery, and charges with all the appearances of RICO violations. Hastings, Co-conspirator, attorney William Borders was sent to jail for his refusal to testify in the Hastings proceedings. President Bill Clinton pardoned Borders on his last day in office for his unspoken sacrifice. Hastings lost bids at a US Senate run and Florida Secretary of State. In 1992, despite his direct ties to criminal misconduct and being impeached as a federal judge, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for the 23rd District of Florida. As a voting member of Congress, Hastings voted to impeached former Texas Judge Samuel Kent for his judicial misconduct on June 19, 2009. Outrageously, Hastings served as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. No one cared to check backgrounds, which removes him from consideration. In 2011, Hastings was rated as the "Poorest Member of Congress", as an elected official. In 2012, Hastings was ranked No. 1 out of 435 members from the U.S. House of Representatives for paying salaries and fees to family members. The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington published a 300 page report that revealed that Congressman Hastings paid his girlfriend $622,574 over a four-year pay period 2007-2010. Hastings tenure on the bench was short lived but he was empowered by Congress and a misled a voting base for nearly forty years to fund his reign of criminal activities which is a standard modus operandi for America's elected politicians, insulated by the judiciary and reciprocal. Term limits and no immunities, echoes the crimes of Alcee Hastings funded with your taxpayer dollars.	 Nakul, ACP Pradyuman's son accuses him to kill his girlfriend in a night club.

Brian insists Lori was clean and innocent, 'something with eyes' in the woods killed Graham after they two fled without looking for him. Now an 18th-century female skull is found in the woods, she underwent trepanation. Further forensics prove an elaborate staging, possible for film professor Nate Gibbons, but there is another person on the videos, and blood DNA on the ax...	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

17039_97440	 Jessica isn't amused to find she was asked 'urgently' to come help San Francisco PI Harry McGraw, in fact to invest in black has-been boxer Blaster Boyle, the sole legacy of Harry's just deceased friend Pinky, who knew mobster Benny Falcone demands a $5,000 advance back for not finding his daughter's lover the saxophonist before the couple move in with Falcone. Harry accepted to field Blaster as last-minute replacement in a TV fight against Wade Talmadge's prize-fighter Sean Shaleen, not to win, but needs an investor to advance the expenses; rather then go 50-50, Jessica lends him $5,000. She learns from Boston Tribune sports reporter Dave Robinson she was listed as Blaster's manager by Henry, who was just arrested by SFPD Lieutenant Casey for the murder of Talmadge, who was found shot in his car parked under a bridge where they are believed to have an appointment, Harry ignores why- alas as forensics prove with Harry's gun, which he admits was never out of his sight. Jessica snoops, like Robionson who flew over, while the fight goes on, with upstepping managers: Dennis McConnell for Sean, Cosmo Ponzini for Blaster... Jessica finds herself working with her old friend private detective Harry McGraw who has decided to become a fight manager. He's lined up a match for his man Blaster Boyle with Sean Shaleen managed by Wade Talmage. With $5000 from Jessica -it's either a loan or an investment depending on which of the two you ask - Harry's on his way. When Talmadge is found dead after getting into an argument with Harry, its the PI who is arrested for murder. Jessica takes over as Buster's fight manager and tries to instill in him the confidence he needs to win while the opposition is trying to get him to take a dive. Amid all of this, Jessica also has a murder to solve. In this pilot -aired as a special- for the series "The Law and Harry McGraw", Jessica and her friend, dodgy private eye Harry McGraw, get tangled up in the fight game as Harry manages boxer Blaster toward his first big fight. They are up against a consortium with a prize fighter in its stable, and the head of the consortium constantly belittles Harry as a seedy character (takes one to know one). The consortium's biggest boxer is taking out "pugs" on his route to the title, and both sides think that there's the possibility of an upset from Harry's man. When Harry argues the point in a trainer's room, his gun discharges. Later, the consortium head is found gunned down and the slug matches Harry's weapon. With Harry in jail on a murder rap, Jessica (who lent Harry money to cover the fighter's expenses) becomes the fighter's unwitting manager and tries to get Harry off the hook.

Crooked lawyer Carlton Rood gets Joe Sholto off the hook for burning down his warehouse for the insurance money. A cop was killed and a cleaning lady blinded in the process but Rodd confuses her in court, winning his client's freedom. The Saint decides to exact his own form by justice by making Sholto believe that Rood is about to rat on him for a reward, thus putting 'the element of doubt' into his mind. The defense attorney Carlton Rood in New York is notorious for his ability to get his clients acquitted by the court, although it's obvious that they are guilty of serious crimes. He is a master of juridical rhetoric, but it also happens that opposing witnesses suddenly die mysteriously.

At the hospital Agnes tells the police that she saw Sholto, who is then charged of murder. In the court Sholto's attorney Carlton Rood dismisses Agnes's testimony as doubtful, because the fire has made her blind, and because a test he constructs, with actors imitating Sholto, shows that she cannot even pick out Sholto's voice.

Inevitably, with a warrant for arson pending, Sholto will turn to Rood for his legal help, as Agnes, who is now blind, threatens to put him behind bars once and for all. Sooner or later, with the aid of Rood's usual trickeries, Sholto will be acquitted and the case will close, nevertheless, the Saint will keep it open. After luring Sholto into a profitable deal, the Saint acting as a powerful catalytic agent will put into action his elaborate scheme that will give Sholto and his legal magician a taste of their own medicine.	-1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0

This show introduced a new character named Professor Ludwig Von Drake, who provides an interesting lowdown on color. The kaleidoscopic intro to the show, composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, further showed off color, which really impressed viewers who would comment on the greatness of it in color, to the obvious glee of one of the program's sponsors, RCA.

32577_76860	 Castle's doubts about method actress Natalie Rhodes playing the title lead in the movie version of his Niki Heat novel "Heat Wave" are laughed away by Becket, which changes after the star joins the team to observe and spookily-well imitates Becket's every way and even her ridiculously expensive taste come in handy. The team's current case is the murder of match-maker Stacy, in whose home a fortune in cash is found, so on top of theatrically dumped ex Brad Williams, her recent clients, their targets and her P.I. Duke Jones, must pass muster. Castle's novel "Heat Wave" is being turned into a movie, and the Hollywood hottie cast as the movie's lead, Natalie Rhodes, shows up at Beckett's invitation to better understand the character she's going to play. As our threesome investigates the murder of a high-class matchmaker, Natalie goes to extremes in the name of "character research," transforming herself into the spitting image of Beckett -- much to Castle's delight and Beckett's dismay.	 When tyrannical CEO Lawrence Hammond and his pretty young wife are murdered at night in a deserted parking lot, Stottlemeyer suspects the CEO's many enemies, but Monk notes that the wife was shot four times and the husband only once, meaning that she was the primary target and the husband "an afterthought." The only clues are the CEO's last words, obsessively repeated: "Girls can't eat fifteen pizzas"--and a computerized navigation system that apparently malfunctioned. A talk with the housekeeper and an examination of the wife's separate bedroom lead Monk to an art studio, where he reluctantly interviews a nude male art instructor and discovers that the wife was having an affair with Major League superstar Scott Gregorio, who was attending the same classes. Gregorio, whose on-field performance has deteriorated since an earlier attack by an assailant with a baseball bat, is clearly devastated by Mrs. Hammond's death and is more a victim himself than a suspect. Seeing his own loss of Trudy reflected in Gregorio's loss, Monk befriends the superstar. Along the way to solving the murder, he umpires a Little League game in which Benjy and Stottlemeyer's son, Jared, are on opposing teams. Gregorio's advice to Benjy, HELP, provides Monk with the clue he needs to decipher Hammond's last words. Meanwhile, Stottlemeyer, taking a delightful turn as a baseball dad, sends Disher in search of clues. Disher proudly exhibits the CD for the car's GPS system and a grainy photograph of the perpetrator from the parking lot's security system, and Monk searches his brain to determine where he's seen that face before. During a visit to the lawyer of a rival baseball player who may be connected with the murder, Monk finds the clue he needs to put all the pieces together.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

Reed and Malloy arrest Sparky a known drug user and thief when they suspect she is high. However, Sgt. Hardwicke tells Reed his case is too weak which turns out to be true. Mac tells Reed about a new program for officers to work alternate duty for 30 days to gain experience. Reed opts to join the vice squad with Hardwicke. It involves new training and a lifestyle that causes friction with his wife due to irregular hours and his environment. He quickly learns the job is dirty due to the type of crime. They bust a a man giving drugs to young boys in return for pictures of them. Malloy is paired with Officer Woods handling the usual calls including one where a woman has disarmed the criminal. Hardwicke follows up by having Reed use his connection with Sparky to have her provide details on two men who rob other dealers and fence goods. During the take down of the men Malloy is wounded. While on patrol, Malloy and Reed pick up one of their known regular junkies, Sparky, who is obviously under the influence of some drug. They also find drug paraphernalia on her person. Reed is told by Sgt. John Hardwick of Narcotics, he who is nicknamed Big Bad John, that their bust was not a good one as there was no probable cause for stopping and thus picking her up. He is correct as Sparky is let go after appearing in court. It is partly because of this situation that Reed jumps at the chance to enter a new 30-day on-the-job training program, he choosing Narcotics of those departments available, which leads to Malloy being partnered with Woods in Adam-12 for the duration. Working under Big Bad John, Reed learns that he has to look the part, which includes having a scruffy street look, and act the part by building relationships with those on the street, which means that the first week will be primarily reading and watching from the sidelines. When Reed does get involved, his first case is of a "chicken" farm where a drug pusher gets young boys addicted to speed, he who then proceeds to take photographs of them. Next, he deals on a larger undercover case, that of nabbing two of the dealers in the area. John believes that Sparky, despite being relatively low on the drug food chain, may be able to assist as a snitch, Reed who would be the one to foster that relationship. This case ends a difficult first few weeks for Reed, who is caught between the law and his own sense of morality. It also plays havoc on his home life, not only as Reed no longer has regular hours, but he is literally and feels figuratively dirty from the work.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

At an international homicide conference in Seattle, Da Vinci learns that Sandy's death is strikingly similar to a number of other recent deaths: the victims are knocked out using the same commercially available barbiturate, they're sexually molested several times and they're ultimately bound and strangled.

Before heading out to sea, he journeys across a frozen landscape on foot, by snowmobile, and by dog sled. The cruise aboard a working deep-sea fishing boat proves difficult for Karl. The next item that Karl chooses from the bucket list is whale watching, as he admits that whales are large and thus interesting animals. Ricky and Stephen send him to Alaska to do so.

10289_38473	 Documentary with interesting behind the wall look at the Tower of London. The 8 episodes covered the Tower as a Fortress, its most famous prisoners, its use as a treasure house, the Tower at war, parts of the Tower no longer standing, the tower as a tourist attraction, its bloody history, and the office of the Constable of the Tower.	 The great gift of man over beasts has been his ability to craft and use tools. A simple stone axe gave man the power to shape the world around him. A spear -- the difference between a family living or dying... But the axe and the spear could also become weapons, as individuals, tribes, and eventually nations struggled against each other in their fierce determination to survive. Since the invention of firearms in China more than 900 years ago, the GUN, has been both a tool to conquer game and a weapon for killing men. GUNS gave individual men great power, and gave groups of men the power to both enforce and resist the will of rulers. The United States of America is a nation born well after the invention of firearms -- a nation whose size and influence expanded alongside the development, and with the use and growth, of personal firearms. What were the GUNS that conquered the land that would become the United States, and how did they develop? How did firearms change the course of this continent's future, and how were advancements in firearm technology used by men and even other nations throughout the American experience? Since 1775 and the "Shot Heard Round the World," American patriots would put muskets to shoulder, and fight for liberty -- a liberty that would be forged in battle, achieved and defended by the AMERICAN GUN. In this new and exclusive 7-part, 400 year history documentary mini-series, we trace and chronicle the events and development of... The GUN, and the Evolution of the Firearm.	-1	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0

That is followed with a call to a bar where a fight was reported between Apache Indians but the fight has stopped when they arrive. Later they receive a tip that a fight to the death is about to occur between the Apaches because one of them is seeing the other one's 16 year old sister. Adam-12 makes it to their latest call, a bar, just after an explosion happens inside. This explosion is just the latest in a string of such bombings of small businesses in Adam-12's patrol area.

3005_108626	 Tierra de Lobos is a western set in 19th century Spain. Translated as Land of Wolves, it's actually named after Anotonio Lobo, the wealthy landowner who controls and owns most of the land. His whole world turns upside down when two outlaws, Cesar and Roman Bravo, decide to return to their childhood home, located on his property. And the conflict intensifies between them when Cesar and Almudena, the eldest of Lobo's four beautiful daughters, end up falling in love. Cesar (Alex Garcia) and Roman (Junio Valverde) Bravo return to the land where they were born, after fleeing from an attempted bank robbery in Portugal, where all of their men get killed. The only resource they have to break from their past and start a new life now, is a broken down shack where they grew up, located at the ravine (La Quebrada). However, their good intentions are hampered by Antonio Lobo (Juan Fernandez), the local landowner who controls the impoverished people of the town and sees the strangers as a threat to his maintained oligarchy. Lobo is a widower who lives with his four daughters, Almudena (Silvia Alonso), Isabel (Adriana Torrebejano), Nieves (Dafne Fernandez) and Rosita (Carla Diaz); all of whom he treats with authority and paternalism. He and his henchmen, led by his foreman Anibal (Antonio Velazquez), try to make the two foreigners leave but can't prevent the emerging love between Lobo's eldest daughter Almudena and Cesar. The livelihood of the Bravo brothers seems impossible: Lobo hates them and none of the towns people except Elena (Maria Castro), supports them. But everything changes when they meet Jean Marie Raymond (Jordi Rico), a flamboyant character who arrives from Switzerland and convinces them that their land lies on a medicinal spring with which they could earn much money. So the Bravo's decide to stay and fight for what's theirs, and along the way, discover dark secrets buried within the collective memory of the 'Land of Wolves'.

In the early 1980s, an armed rebellion breaks out in the fictional Middle Eastern kingdom of Asran. Fighter pilots from all over the world are being hired as mercenaries, or even shanghaied on occasion, by both sides of the conflict to fly and fight for them. One of the locations where Asran's government sends its mercenaries is Area 88, a secret military airbase surrounded by desert and close to the frontline, where they must live and can never leave it. Since every pilot has his or her own unique fighter jet, the airbase often looks like it's hosting an exhibition of various real-life fighter planes from all over the world. There are only three ways for a government-hired mercenary pilot to quit this war - complete a three year contract as a mercenary, pay a fine of one and a half million US dollars, which is an improbable but not impossible feat, since every confirmed kill can bring up to 75 grand in rewards to the pilot responsible, or try to escape, although desertion is punished by death. Shin Kazama, a strong silent type is a respected combat ace and the only Japanese pilot among the mercenaries in Area 88. He is also one of the few that were deceived into joining the war. To make things worse, the man responsible for this cruel deception was his best friend, which puzzles Shin. The people closest to Shin on the base are hotshot US pilot and war vet Micky Simon, very young and insecure but spirited North African pilot Kim Aba, the only female fighter pilot on the base - self-confidant and competitive Kitori Palvanaff who's also airbase commander Saki's cousin and aggressive overzealous photojournalist Makoto Shinjou who's recently arrived from Japan, supposedly to report on the war, but who has a somewhat suspicious fascination with Shin. All Shin wants is to earn the 1.5 mil, pay the fine and return home to the girl he loves. What he doesn't know is that he's running out of time to accomplish this.	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0

Carrie assures him their affair is not even known to her CIA colleagues and Mike helps him overcome Jessica's fear for press scrutiny of their adulterous affairs; Saul's team finds that traitor sniper Tom walker's paying contact is Saudi embassy diplomat Mansour Al-Zahrani. To bypass his immunity, he's blackmailed with his gambling debts and anti-Islamic gay bathhouse pleasures, enough to ruin his entirely Westernized family. However, the trap set for Walker goes awfully wrong. The CIA learns that Saudi diplomat, Mansour Al-Zahrani, is acting as one of the conduits between Abu Nazir and Tom Walker. They also learn of two issues in Al-Zahrani's life which they want to exploit in getting him to talk, primarily about Walker's current location and his mission for Nazir. Against the objections of the state department, the CIA, using those two issues, sets up a sting operation on Al-Zahrani to bring him in, at least for a couple of hours before the Saudi Embassy realizes that he may be missing. To her surprise, David asks Carrie to be the lead interrogator. Beyond the two issues, Carrie realizes that she will have to push the right buttons with Al-Zahrani, as, according to Virgil's assessment, he is the type of man either to sing like a jaybird if even slightly pressured, or die for his country. Meanwhile, Brody receives a visit from the Vice-President who asks him to run for what will soon be a vacant seat in Congress. On the surface, Brody does whatever he can to receive Jess' support so that he can accept the nomination. However, she and the western world are unaware of Brody's ulterior motives. And Carrie is excited about a date request. The eventual encounters ends up being anything but, much to her emotional dismay. The CIA now focus their investigation on Mansour Al-Zahrani, Second Secretary at the Saudi embassy and Abu Nazir's operative in the USA. He has several weaknesses not the least of which are huge debts resulting from bad investments and a penchant for spending Thursday afternoons at a gay bathhouse. They want to interrogate him for a few hours and David Estes decides Carrie should lead the interrogation. He turns to a surprising source for help in convincing her. Brody is surprised at home when Vice President William Walden visits him. He wants Brody to run for the recently vacated Congressional seat but when Jess hears about the offer, she's dead set against it. Brody turns to an old friend to try and get her on side.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

Morse had not been involved in the case as he was on leave during most of that investigation. What piques Morse's interest is that one of the victims, Karen Anderson, was never found and it is assumed that her body was dumped in a nearby lake but Parnell confessed to his priest on his deathbed that he wasn't responsible for that particular murder. When one of the witnesses in the case, George Daly, is murdered, Morse and Lewis try to find some connection to Anderson's disappearance.

The agents talk about executions of those sentenced to death which only aggravates Warren's condition. Warren asks to go to the bathroom and in desperation runs away through the bathroom window. However, the agents and the sheriff immediately intercept him and one of the agents even plans to beat him up but his colleague arrives in time to prevent it. Warren asks about the details of the murder he's been arrested for and nothing the agents say sounds familiar or even makes sense to him. He claims he's never even held a gun since his tour of duty in the Korean War. The agents claim they have a more than solid case backed by firm evidence that he's the shooter. They eventually agree to stay in a hotel for the evening, since everyone's getting tired, and continue their trip in the morning.

A call to a night club finds a singer, Kathy, strung out on drugs causing a disturbance. She finds security with Reed who rides with her to the hospital. She tells him someone is trying to kill her and giving her drugs. Narcotics believes she can provide a lead to new drugs and ask Reed to go undercover with Kathy as a soldier AWOL with a big cache of heroin to sell. He agrees and although he makes a deal, the girl burns him under pressure. The narcotics squad lose Reed but Malloy arrives as the dealers are trying to kill Reed and Kathy. Malloy and Reed are called to a nightclub where one of the on-stage performers, singer Kathy Royal, is on a rampage, seemingly on some sort of psychotic break. While in the back of an ambulance, she confides to Reed that "they" are trying to kill her. Meanwhile, the paramedics believe she's high, and thus do not want to tranquilize her until they know what she's using. On listening further to Kathy's story, Reed finds that her account and the paramedics' beliefs are not incompatible. As such, Reed is given an undercover assignment by Narcotics to discover the supply of new drugs - "rainbows" and "grasshoppers" - that are hitting the streets and that "they" are probably giving Kathy. An uncomfortable Malloy won't even be able to watch from the sidelines as Mac can't afford to spare him from work. Beyond the obvious risks of getting caught by the pushers, Reed will have to watch out for a needy Kathy, who may quickly fall for him, and he somewhat for her.	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

So losing it in a black hole somewhere in deep space is a bit of a worry. Not least, he says, because without it he'll have to settle down and get a mortgage. In this two-parter (The Impossible Planet and next week's The Satan Pit), the Doctor and Rose land in a ramshackle spaceship stationed on an obscure planet that's trapped in permanent orbit round an all-consuming black hole.

The Doctor and Rose arrive on a planet that should not be there - it's on the edge of a black hole. The answer seems to lie in a counterbalancing gravitational force emitted by the planet. The human scientists are there to study the phenomenon and are assisted by a subservient race of beings, known as the Ood. The surface of the planet is unstable and the Tardis vanishes into a pit. It soon becomes clear that here is a creature of some sore living in the pit and that the Ood are not the benevolent creatures they at first appear to be.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

3321_57890	 Member of Parliament John Hodgson, who Alec believes will be the next Prime Minister, is stopping by Avonlea on an official visit and will be staying at the White Sands Hotel. It's not a good time for the visit as a cold is going through the area (Mr. Tremayne and Gus being among the many who are currently afflicted), resulting in the hotel being short staffed, which in turn leaves Felix to assume many additional duties. But Felix becomes preoccupied with another guest, namely John's pretty young daughter, Adeline. She likes the attention as she is feeling neglected by her always busy father. While on the island, John is looking for a potential candidate to run for the party locally. He thinks Alec is the perfect choice. Despite never having had political aspirations, Alec thinks about the good he may be able to do for the people of the island as a Member of Parliament. Alec's deliberations ultimately have to take into consideration the rigidity of party politics and what he may deem as unscrupulous pork barrel politics. Meanwhile, there have been a rash of thefts of late at the hotel. Top on the suspect list is new staff member, Elbert Werts, who comes from a poor background. But Felix thinks the real thief is someone else, and he has to figure out what to do when he finds out the truth.	 The world tour ends. Lord Auberon comes to Manhattan to track down Puck, and Titania's offspring.

37080_112734	 Will arrives at the BAU office with news that JJ has gone missing. On JJ's directive if she ever did go missing, Will has come to inform Mat, who would "know what to do" as the two are still working on a top secret case from their joint State Department days. This news surprises the rest of the team, as they had no idea JJ and Mat even knew each other prior to him being appointed Section Chief. However, they all discover that Mat is also missing, which they fear the worst for both JJ and Mat. Hotch is able to find out some basic information about what JJ and Mat were working on - that is was an Afghanistan based mission in trying to locate 'Osama bin Laden' (qv) - but the BAU is told by the State Department not only to mind their own business as their disappearances are a State Department matter, but that they are to cease any work in trying to find either JJ or Mat or face the consequences if they do. The team ignores this directive, but they know that they have to work clandestinely to avoid detection by the State Department. They call in reinforcements in the form of Emily, who was in contact with JJ during her State Department years, and thus may have extra insight into what JJ was working on. They quickly discover that the person who has probably kidnapped JJ and Mat is a man named Tivon Askari, who worked as a translator on Mat and JJ's crew in Afghanistan but who was discovered to be a double agent, one who went to the highest bidder. But the team not only has to find out what Askari's goal is and where he may have taken the pair, but they also have to find out something that JJ already knows about someone else in their Afghanistan crew to uncover the full details and thus JJ and Mat's location.

7672_63572	 In April and May 1945, the long-suffering Dutch people enthusiastically welcomed their Canadian liberators, establishing an intense connection that has sustained for 70 years. Following victory in the Scheldt Campaign, the First Canadian Army spent November 1944 to February 1945 holding the Nijmegen salient. Throughout, the largest Dutch cities remained under Nazi control, as the Allies, apprehensive of friendly civilian casualties, instead attacked Germany directly. The Dutch would have preferred a more robust strategy. In response to a national railway strike in September 1944, the Nazis shut off millions of urban Dutch from the farms that supplied their food, leading to the Hongerwinter (Hunger Winter). The famine killed over 20,000 people and reduced hundreds of thousands to subsisting on vermin, refuse, and tulip bulbs. After the successes of the Rhineland Campaign in February-March, First Canadian Army - reinforced by the arrival of 1st Canadian Division and 5th Canadian Armoured Division from Italy - re-entered the Netherlands in early April and finally liberated the country. It was a difficult, emotional experience. The Canadians knew the war would soon end and no one wanted to be killed, much as they wished to help the Dutch.

20383_66554	 When Frank Fox is sentenced to Broadmoor for murder, the team reopens the death of his colleague Josh Livesey, killed at a NATO base where the two men and their group were planning a protest twenty years earlier. All the campaigners, when reinterviewed, claim that Josh was killed by the Secret Service, which Brian accepts especially after a film shows that a section of the wire at the base was replaced the night Josh died. Charming Special Branch Officer Greg Johnson admits to Sandra that his people disposed of Josh's body and the murder weapon to avoid publicity, but he denies involvement in the killing. At the same time, secrets amongst the campaigners also come to light, leading to several likely suspects. Sandra and the team reopen the case of 22 year-old Josh Livesay whose body was found not far from an anti-nuclear protest camp in 1984. He was struck on the head and likely died of exposure but according to the now retired DI Graham Moore the body had definitely been moved and there is basically no forensic information available. According to his tent-mates at the protest site, Frank Fox and Imogen Hoult, Livesay left the tent around 1 a.m. Frank Fox recently killed a man and is now in a mental hospital. He believed the man he killed was a government agent who was following him. The others in the tents still believe Livesay was killed by the Security Service.

22141_103190	 Congress has poured seven billion dollars into a large and deep hole in the ground - the home of Project TicToc and its revolutionary new technology, the Time Tunnel. A mechanism intended to access past and future, the tunnel is not quite ready despite a decade of work and all the billions. Senator Clark declares his intention to cut funding and abandon the project. Desparate scientist Tony Newman uses the apparatus to send himself through time to prove the concept. But the TicToc team cannot retrieve him, and so his mentor Doug Phillips goes back to help Tony out of the peril he has landed in: he has arrived on the RMS Titanic mere days before she struck an iceberg and sank!	 Evolutionary zoologist Professor Nick Cutter has still not come to terms with the disappearance of his wife Helen eight years ago. She is on his mind when he goes to the Forest of Dean with his friends Stephen Hart (an expert tracker) and Connor Temple (an archaeology student and avid conspiracy theorist) to investigate some reports of a large animal at large there. After finding some damage done by something large with claws they retire to a local hotel bar where Cutting is approached in a matter sure to get his immediate attention by Claudia Brown, a young employee of the Home Office, and the four set off back into the forest to try to find whatever made those claw marks and did that damage. Coincidentally, peroxide blonde Abby Maitland, a zoo keeper devoted to reptiles (especially lizards, iguanas, and chameleons), hears that day from her boss that, despite her dedication to her work, she'll soon be out of a job because of budget cuts. Meanwhile she takes on a visit to a local household on the edge of the Forest of Dean where a young boy has an unusual reptile pet that he found in the forest. This turns out to be a hitherto unknown species of flying lizard, so she sets off with the boy who intends to show her where he found it. Thus the protagonists of this series meet up in the forest and encounter their first Anomaly, and one or two of the dinosaurs that have arrived in the present day by walking through it. Brown has to call in the authorities and we meet James Lester, the arrogant Downing Street troubleshooter who "will be leading the response" of the British government to these discoveries. Indue course, Nick Cutter and a Special Forces minder step through the Forest of Dean anomaly, and discover that more than one person, including Helen Cutter, had indeed been in the prehistoric landscape on the other side and that at least one of them had not survived. Meanwhile, a carnivorous dinosaur rampages through a local school after hours, when the only people about are one small boy in detention, and the teacher minding him who (of course) is dismissive when he says "Miss, there's a dinosaur in the playground!" --- until, that is, it starts trying to smash its way into the classroom where they are cowering.	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

29227_72532	 Cirkeline (Eng: Circleen) is a Danish comic book character, created by Hanne Hastrup in 1957. The character is a little elf with spiky black hair, who wears a red dress with black dots and prefers walking barefoot. Between 1968 and 1971 the comic was adapted for a series of animated shorts, when Hanne Hastrup wrote the scripts and Jannik Hastrup animated and produced 18 short films for DR TV. The last of the short films, Flugten Fra Amerika (Escape from America) has an anti-American message that prevented it from being broadcast.[1][2][dead link] No new Cirkeline films were released until 1998. The first Cirkeline book was published in 1969, and in 1998 she took the leap to the big cinema screen in the first of 3 feature films. Cirkeline became a brand, which has grown stronger and stronger ever since and today there are 9 books, music CDs and a range of products from underwear to cups and plates. Several of the film's songs, written by Hans-Henrik Ley, have become classics - e.g. "Bim, Bam, Busse" ("Mile, Male, Mole"), "Snemusen Knud" ("Knut the Snowmouse") and "Cirkeline har f√∏dselsdag" ("Circleen's birthday").

Rather than elude law enforcement, he decides to have some fun first and go on a spree, impersonating an officer. It's up to Reno and Bobby to bring the bounty back into custody before he pulls off a planned heist, or before his anti-psychotic medication runs out and he does any serious damage.

10746_103208	 Disraeli's stature in the party continues to grow and he manages to gain the favor of Queen Victoria and her consort Prince Albert. The Great Game - politics - continues to be Disraeli's great passion, whether he finds himself in or out of government. His great foe, the Liberals' Gladstone, proves to be a staunch and unwavering opponent who, despite the similarity of their views, is unprepared to work with Disraeli on issues in which they share similar opinions. His marriage to Mary Anne grows ever more loving and they form a great partnership. Mary Anne is not well however and their days together may be numbered.	 The story starts at the point in Benito Mussolini's life when, at the age of nineteen, he gave up being a schoolmaster, left his home town of Forli and, as a guest worker on a building-site in Lausanne, Switzerland, underwent his own personal experience of the darker sides of the capitalist system. The speed with which the rhetorically gifted demagogue manages to assemble whole crowds of friends and followers around him - including above all his "protectress", the enigmatic Russian woman Angelika - is reflected in the speed at which he succeeds in attracting enemies from church and state. His love for the beautiful Eleonora, the daughter of a middle-class family, studying medicine at the University of Geneva - a city where Mussolini himself has been carrying stone around as an unskilled worker - even convinces him to take up studying. When a fatal accident occurs on the building-site - a worker plunges to his death from a badly-secured section of scaffolding - the young student Mussolini calls for a general strike. Arrest and expulsion are the consequences of this first piece of agitation, and it is only the intervention of his influential friend Angelika which saves him from being thrown into jail. But Mussolini is not a man to give up easily. Soon he's successful again, in Trieste, working as editor of the socialist newspaper "L'Avventure del Lavoratore", and a conflict soon arises between himself and the local clergy. This, however, provides the local imperial Austrian authorities with the excuse they need to expel this troublemaker and agitator from the country. Back in his native town of Forl√¨, Mussolini marries Rachele, his childhood sweetheart. But he's still a long way from settling down into a "bourgeois" lifestyle - he spends far more time with his comrades, and especially the pretty female comrades, than with Rachele and the family. It's not long before Mussolini becomes local chief of the Italian Socialist Party, in which he reveals his secure instinct for power and his talent for intrigue as he plays off various sections of the left against each other. Very soon he's levered his arch-rival Bissolati out of office: in Milan Mussolini becomes editor-in-chief of the country's largest socialist newspaper, "Avanti!". Mussolini exploited the escalation in violence among the country's workers for his own ends. The "reds" - the left-wing Socialists - and the "yellows" - the Republicans - were involved in a bitter war with each other. At the peak of this crisis, however, World War I broke out. While the Italian Nationalists are urging the country to take part in the war, the left wing builds its support on the pacifist strength of the "Socialist International": the workers of Europe must unite against the imperialist warmongers! Now that those in power represent a common enemy, Mussolini - via an adroit move - succeeds in uniting the warring left-wing factions. Although hopes that a united European left will be able to stop the war are soon dashed, Mussolini is now more powerful than ever before. It is at this period of his life that he begins to have growing doubts about neutrality and pacifism being worthy aims for a true revolutionary. Gradually he turns all his allies, even the staunchest ones, into enemies, including his beloved Angelika, by showing a lot of sympathy towards the landowning classes. The last great chapter in the history of Mussolini the socialist is now played out against the backdrop of World War I, and the transformation begins which will eventually lead him to found an entirely different type of socialism altogether - Fascismo. While the pacifists in his party are pressing for neutrality, Mussolini finally allows himself to be "bought" by the Conservative government. The former anti-war campaigner turned opportunist now supports the war. Now he's on his own - and at the turning-point of his political career...	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0

32807_65069	 In the early 17th century, Japan adopted strict isolation policies and severed almost all ties with foreign countries. In 1853, the US fleet commanded by Admiral Perry forced the doors open, leading to a modernization of the nation's sociopolitical systems and the eventual fall of the Shogunate.

"The X-Files" writer/executive producer Howard Gordon presents an exploration of a nefarious world where "big business" funds "big science," and the answers Paul Turner finds lead to more questions than have ever been imagined. After exposure to chemical weapons during the Gulf War, ex-Government scientist Turner spent six isolated years fighting for his life until an enigmatic Asian woman saved him with a miraculous cure...that lasted only temporarily. Ever since, the illness has regularly returned to ravage Turner's body until the woman mysteriously reappears to provide another dose. After a six year absence, Turner returns to the Army as a Special Investigator in charge of tracking down the Frankensteins of the world.

The cards eventually turn against Paul. Meanwhile, Sidney is approached by a friendly mysterious man, who claims he can help her boyfriend get better and expose the organization.

Reed's dog Queenie's recent litter of eight pups are now six weeks old, and it's time for Reed to find homes for them, which is proving to be difficult. Malloy even skirts the issue with Reed as he obviously doesn't want one, despite Reed needing to ask anyway.

The second has them dealing with a young boy who has his head stuck been the grates of a metal fence. Their last call of the evening is of prowler/peeping Tom.

In 2010, Robert Kinsey is president of a brave new world since he concluded the alliance with the Aschen, a race discovered by SG-1 which lets humanity enjoy its far advanced science and technology, including a vaccine against aging. Sam is now a civilian scientist, married to ambassador Joe Faxon, whose only worry is failing to get pregnant. When she double-checks the Ashen doctor Mollem's computer with Dr. Fraser, who felt superfluous given superior medicine, they discover human fertility is down 90% worldwide in three years. Sam, Daniel and Teal'c turn to retired general Jack, who always warned against handing over technological control, for a daring plan to turn the clock back like general Hammond did once, sending a message to their past with the exact time of a solar flare, which Sam can calculate using the Ashen computer. Only one ingredient is out of their reach: the GDO device to control the Stargate's iris, which is in the White House. Sam implores her husband Joe to steal it, but he has a secret as well as sincere objections... It's 2010 and the members of SG-1 have moved on with their lives. O'Neill is retired; Sam is married to a diplomat, Joe Faxon; Teal'c has returned to Chulak; and Daniel is working as an archaeologist. It's been 10 years since SG-1 visited P4C970 and met the Aschen who have shared their technology with Earth. The stargate is no longer a secret and people can now travel anywhere they wish. Sam had been hoping to get pregnant but she and Dr. Fraiser make a startling discovery: Earth's fertility rate has dropped by 91%. It clearly has to do with the Achen and using their advanced technology, she hopes to send a message back to Earth, 10 years in the past, to stop SG-1 from ever going to P4C970. O'Neill, grumpy as ever, had warned them not to visit that planet in the first and in the end agrees to help them out. Whether they will be able to change the future remains the question. In 2010, Earth is celebrating the tenth anniversary of the alliance with the Aschen, an advanced race that SG-1 encountered and has defeated the Goa'uld and provided science and technology to improve the quality of life of the Earthlings. Among the improvements, the Aschen have developed a vaccine against aging. Sam is a civilian scientist, married with Ambassador Joe Faxon and has been unsuccessfully trying to have a baby for three years but the Aschen doctor tells that she is healthy. When she meets Dr. Fraiser, she invites Sam to be submitted to exams at her office. Dr. Fraiser discovers that Sam is infertile and soon they learn that 90% of the women on Earth have the same problem, as the result of the Aschen vaccine, as part of a plan to conquer Earth. Sam summons Daniel, Teal'c and the retired Jack to send a warning message to the past to themselves using a solar flare. But the problem is that the Garage Door Opener (GDO) device is in the White House with President Robert Kinsey. How can they get the device to send the message? It's 2010, ten years since SG-1 made contact with an alien race called the Aschen. With their help, the Goa'uld have been defeated, and diseases such as cancer have been wiped out. The Aschen's advanced technology has not only ensured the planet's safety, but it has won them the respect and friendship of all humanity. But things are not all as they seem to be as Samantha Carter learns she can not have children. Deeper investigation reveals that the various vaccines handed out by the Aschen have managed to sterilize over 90% of the population. With no hope of being able to fight the Aschen, SG-1 comes to realize that there is still hope: send a message through the Stargate to stave off disaster - ten years in the past.	-1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0

Their latest case takes them to Portland, Oregon, where four bodies are found in a mass grave. Each victim was tortured prior to death, but there are no signs of sexual assault. Since they had no defensive wounds, the victims probably knew and trusted the unsub. Some of the victims were never reported missing since the unsub took on the victim's electronic identity and sent electronic messages as the victim to family and friends. These facts mean the unsub has personal knowledge of his victims. The common thread between the four victims is that they had all recently moved to Portland from elsewhere, leading to the thought that they were met by the unsub in the natural course of relocation. After a fifth victim is found, Reid finds another connection: each death is associated with a different anxiety disorder. They have to discover how the unsub lures his victims to their death in such a trusted manner. After the case has concluded, Hotch admits to Morgan why he has been more anxious than usual.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

26714_50797	 Reese finally decides to meet with Carter, who, by helping him and Finch in their next case, is provided a little insight into what he and Finch do. Reese is hoping that Carter will see the merit in their association despite the illegal nature of many of his and Finch's actions. Regardless, Reese decides not to tell either Carter or Fusco of their mutual association. That next case is of a young attorney named Andrea Gutierrez, a woman originally from the proverbial wrong side of the tracks, and who has gone deep into debt in financing both her schooling and independent legal business. Her six previous cases have all been for ex-cons who have had a grudge against some aspect of the justice system which has done them wrong.

Her seventh and latest case, which is no different, is representing Terrence King, an ex-con who was sent back to jail on a parole violation. Reese and Finch believe Andrea's violent incident will be associated to King or one of her past clients. In further digging, they find connections between that violent incident to King's less than caring parole officer, Dominic Galuska, and Terrence's son Jacob King who is currently in foster care because of Terrence's imprisonment. Meanwhile, Reese hopes to find out more about Finch's private life through a reconnection Finch makes with someone from his past.

36599_73092	 Someone calling himself "Kahili" (the Hawaiian god of battle) wages his own personal war against polluters. At first the pranks are bad but not dangerous, like climbing a ladder to the top of a huge chimney with a 125-pound ceremonial shield and capping the chimney (thus blowing out the furnace inside and chasing everyone out of the factory). However, Kahili's actions get steadily more violent. After blasting a crop-dusting plane with a shotgun (he pulls the pilot to safety), Kahili types up a list of the five worst polluters in Hawaii and entitles it "Kahili Death List." One of the five suffers a heart attack and another flees, so Kahili goes after the most heavily guarded of the three and breaks his neck with one hand. Can Five-O identify Kahili (whose face is never really seen) and capture him without getting shot or beaten to death?	 The killer: Marion Reader, an aging woman with a bad back, whose twenty-eight year old mama's boy of a son, Owen Reader, came back to live with her to take care of her. With her telephone sales job and his online selling of military memorabilia, they are now unable to make the monthly mortgage payments on her long time house. As a side hobby, she does kitschy folk art: paintings of her cat, Mathias, inserted onto existing painted canvases. As a means to earn more money to make those mortgage payments, she attempts to sell her folk art at a local caf√©. The victim: Julia Conrad, a girl Friday at a high end art gallery. Julia is found dead shot point blank apparently when she was out for her morning run. Homicide's initial suspect is Julia's boss, who is openly disapproving of Julia's plans to open her own art gallery, which would then be "the competition". But when they learn the gun that was used to kill Julia is pre-WWI vintage in poor condition, the fact of such a reported stolen gun by Owen Reader leads them to the Reader house. Although they learn of a connection between the Readers and Julia, they have no motive or logical reasoning to suspect either of the Readers. However, the extent to which Owen and Marion will go to protect the other may bring that motive to light.	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	0

34688_114590	 With the King of Naples dead, Lucrezia sends for her son. The year 1500 is approaching and Pope Alexander has declared it to be a year of jubilation. Expecting large numbers of pilgrims in Rome, he wants the Church to provide the spectacle they will expect. He wants the cardinals to come up with money-making ideas. He also puts pressure on the representatives of the Constantinople Jews who came to seek permission to live in Rome, to contribute to the holy crusade against the Turks. Yet they have a different contribution in mind. The plague has returned and Caterina Sforza looks to use it as a weapon against the Pope. Cesare returns with his own army countering the Sforzas influence and intent on taking Milan. He quickly gains several allies. He is outsmarted however. The pope is determined the approaching JUbilee year 1500 must generate funds for the new St. Peter's basilica and a crusade against the Turks, so the cardinals are ordered to compete in devising lucrative methods to milk the flood of pilgrims, such as indulgences (essentially bought absolutions). Jewish refugees from the Ottoman-overrun Byzantinian empire remnants seek refuge and trading rights, but can't offer lavish sums for the privilege. Instead, their leader Mattai proposes the spear of Longinus, used at the Christ's passion, which a cardinal rationally suspect to be just another forgery, but the pope 'chooses to believe'. Catharina Sforza's henchman collects pest germs to infect a peace proposal sent in his name to the pope. However Cesare forbids presenting it to the pope, an ambitious cardinal keeps it himself and thus brings the epidemic into the papal palace. Cesare returns from France with a wife and an army, strong enough to lure the aristocratic families to his side and conquer Milan on the other Sforza branch, but the duke was tipped off and evacuated his city. Lucrezia is happily reunited with Paolo's son, but anxiously awaits who will succeed the king, two princes being in line before husband Alfonso.

Five students aged 19 are found horribly murdered in a vacant house in Terra Mesa, New Mexico, unbound, skinned alive, one impaled alive: traditional Indian torture methods. The team quickly suspects it must be the collective work of a 'pack'. First they consider the local reservation policeman Benjamin Blackwood's son John, a teacher noted for Indian activism. His tracker skills on the murder site concludes it was not the work of real Indians, as no tribe practiced all these methods, he agrees to act as a consultant. As the killers were probably not Indian but wanted it to appear so, next suspects are the heavily armed ADU. They were founded by local businessman Roy Minton, mainly recruiting from construction, to fight the Indian land claims. A fingerprint belongs to a sixth student, Ingrid Greisen. Her parents say they didn't even know she was missing as she lived totally apart. After father Peter Greisen follows the team's advice to call for Ingrid's release on TV, the kidnappers call. They are two ex-cons, who surrender and show the van she's in, after a promise nothing is told to the father.

The hunt for the cult is on after Ingrid tells what she learned inside about the self-proclaimed 'Apaches' lead by 'Grandfather'. In Terra Mesa, New Mexico, five nineteen year old Mesa University freshmen are found in a house, dead, tortured before their death. Because of the nature of the crime scene, the BAU believe there was a sixth person present - a female - who is now assumed missing. Because the victim wounds showed signs of little resistance, the BAU also believe that a group committed the crime. Beyond being basically skinned alive, the victims' deaths, according to Reid, were following the war rituals of the Native American Plains Indians. The initial thought is that the deaths have something to do with local Apache land claims, the land seized by the government. The BAU's initial discussion with the local Apaches is with John Blackwolf, a local activist and the reservation police, he who is also a suspect. But the nature of the murders may point to an anti-Native American group as the unsubs, they who are trying to implicate the Apaches. When the BAU learn that the identity of the missing sixth person is Ingrid Greisen, they at least know the nature of the unsub group with who they are dealing and its leader, someone known as "Grandfather". Meanwhile, Hotch has an argument with his twenty-five year old brother, Sean, who does not want to follow in the family footsteps and become a lawyer.

After his five year research project is canceled - one of the small Martian organisms he was working on nearly escapes from the lab - Dr. Simon Kress takes one of them home and continues his work in a home lab. The experiments had their origins in testing how Earth life interacts with Martian soil. What they found were tiny eggs in the Martian soil and Kress' experiments found the necessary conditions for gestation. With the project now terminated, Kress steals 265 grams of Martian soil and some of the new life forms he created, called Sandkings. He believes that the tiny creatures are beginning to show signs of intelligence. The creatures soon come to recognize him but when he is stung by one of them, he begins to transform and the creatures turn on him.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	-1	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0

The planet Orban, with Precolumbian Teotihuacan-culture antecedents and Aztec type pyramids, has made impressive scientific progress, and brings Sam a naquadah reactor to study; when she demands an instructor, Orban official Kalan surprises SG-1 by saying that he does not know what an instructor is, but 11 year-old Merrin stays on base to teach Carter. On Orban, Kalan's son Tomin, another 'urrone' (apprentice) is assigned to exchange knowledge about the Goa'uld with Teal'c and Daniel. SG-1 and Dr. Fraiser are astonished to discover the Orban urrones know neither fun nor school: a mass of useful new information is acquired while they are young and stored in the easily reproducible form of nanites, which are implanted in every Orbanian's brain after the urrone's 'averium', a coming of age ceremony at age 12, which extracts the knowledge from the individual and ends their ability to function mentally, so those children are 'retired' for life and from the active society. The Orbanians are furiously insulted by any suggestion to avoid an averium for the child's sake, yet Jack retains Merrin to let her experience how earth children spend their youth in schooling and play, offering it to her as an alternative to the averium, with a remarkable result... On the planet Orban, SG-1 is excavating a site that shows the Goa'uld had been to planet many years before. They are being assisted by highly gifted children, referred to as the Urrone. One of them, 11 year-old Merrin, travels to Stargate Command to deliver a small reactor and agrees to stay on to show Sam Carter how the device works. A routine medical examination however reveals that there are nanites in her system and she explains that this is how her people acquire knowledge. They are all taken somewhat aback when they learn that Teal'c's young friend Tomin has his nanites removed and distributed among the population something that happens to all Urrone when they reach the age of 12. Jack O'Neill has a problem with that. The SG-1 is exchanging experience with the inhabitants of the scientifically developed planet Orban. The representative Kalan gives a naquadah reactor to Sam to study and she requests someone to couch her. Kalan does not understand the request but the girl Merrin offers to train Sam. Meanwhile Kalan's son Tomin learns from Teal'c the danger of the Goa'uld. Merrin is submitted to medical examination by Dr. Fraiser and she finds that she has nanites implanted in her brain. Soon Merrin explains that when they reach twelve years old, they have a ceremony called Averium when all their knowledge is removed together with the nanites to be implanted in the scientists to bring progress to their people. Further, the children become slow with the removal of the nanites. Jack has become attached to Merrin and does not accept the explanation. However Daniel understands the explanation of Kalan and tries to explain Jack that Merrin must return to her planet. But Jack abducts Merrin to show her something on the surface and outside of the SGC. What will Jack do with Merrin?	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	-1	0	0

While fixing a burst water main, a city works crew digs up the back yard of the home of the Johnsons - father Charles, mother Tina, and their middle aged son Lyle - upon Tina's approval. The Johnsons have lived at the house for thirty-five years. The crew finds the skeletons of two human bodies buried in the yard. The BAU takes the three members of the Johnson family in for questioning, who they believe know something about the skeletons, primarily because Lyle ran when he saw the authorities at the house. While Hotch, JJ, Morgan, Rossi and Cruz question the Johnsons individually, Lyle initially comes across as the most guilty by his animosity, however the team eventually believes his attitude is more a facade hiding other issues. Charles also demonstrates a more reserved form of animosity, he being a history buff who continually implies how he and his family, as being black, have been persecuted, this situation being no different.

18251_50105	 "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" was among the most famous, longest-lasting and fondly-remembered children's television shows. Host Fred Rogers (known to millions as simply "Mister Rogers") used his gentle charm and mannerisms to communicate with his audience of children. Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children, ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep, getting immunizations and disappointment about not getting one's way to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and, on nearly every show, segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments, said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchilde and Daniel Striped Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975, at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers' shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War.

50187_56365	 Audrey Chadwick's corpse is found on a church altar and, whilst she told her parents and landlady she was a nurse, the not so happily married Bacchus recognizes her as a hostess at a Playboy-style drinking club he has used, called Rakes, run by brash American Patrick Donovan. Audrey had had an abortion - news to her volatile boyfriend - and the doctor who performed it tells Gently it was because she had been raped. Margaret Bishop, an anti-abortionist, heads a group picketing to close Rakes but her husband is Donovan's lawyer and very much at odds with Margaret's views. He admits intimacy with Audrey but denies rape, nonetheless making him the prime suspect. After the murderer has been unmasked the club is shut down and Gently, having earlier accused Bacchus of being out of condition for his youth, bizarrely takes him on in a charity boxing match. Inspector Gently and Det. John Bacchus investigate the murder of Audrey Chadwick who is found laid out on the altar of a local church. Her grieving parents inform them that she was a nurse and was about to move to London to take up a new job. Bacchus however remembers her as a scantily clad hostess at an upscale club and casino, Rakes, going by the name of Blaise. The club's owners, Patrick and Helen Donovan, says the dead woman was a good employee but that she had quit some three weeks before. A friend and fellow employee, Fawn Granger, tells them that Audrey's father and her boyfriend had learned she worked there. Gently learns from moral crusader Margaret Bishop that there is an abortionist in town and George is convinced that the dead woman was seeing someone, likely a customer at the club. When Fawn disappears Gently understands they have little time to solve the case.

21989_25251	 The first two matches of the 'Justice 5' tournament are complete, and things aren't looking good for Tyson's squad, G Revolutions. BEGA's team is up two games to one in the best-of-five series. If they lose another match, BEGA will be victorious and have complete control over the sport of Beyblading. This puts a lot of pressure on Max to win game three against Mystel. Tyson and the others argue whether Max's signature defensive style will be enough to overcome Mystel's unpredictable and overpowering attack. Max takes this as a sign that his teammates only think he can win if he changes the way he Beyblades altogether. His confidence shattered, Max isolates himself and does some soul-searching. He receives a morale boost from a unlikely source - Rick, his contentious PPB All Starz partner. Rick helps Max realize that his trademark style is what made him so successful as a Blader, and it would be foolish not to use it just because the odds are against him. Max never wanted to give up his defensive tactics in the first place, so Rick's advice only strengthens his resolve to simply do what he does best. When the time comes for his battle against Mystel, Max uses his time-tested strategies. He's quickly overwhelmed by Mystel's wild, hard-hitting attack, and defeat seems eminent. But Draciel's spectacular defense curtails the downward spiral, and the match ends in a draw. The stalemate result isn't the victory that Max desired, but it successfully postpones any chance of losing the tournament for at least one more match. For the underdog G Revolutions team, momentum has finally turned in their favor.	 Just after finding a new Digi-Egg, the DigiDestined are attacked by Flymon and MetalGreymon, under the control of the Emperor's improved Dark Spiral.

23555_115098	 Reworking material from his first novel, "Hide and Seek" (1973), and folding this into a prismatic blend of autobiographical details, popular music and 1940s film noir, Dennis Potter delivered a drama now regarded as a 20th-century masterwork.

As past events and 1940s songs surface in his subconscious, Marlow's voyage of self-discovery provides a key to conquering his illness, while his noir-styled hallucinations evoke the Philip Marlowe of Chandler's "Murder, My Sweet" (1944), starring Dick Powell, who later became a "singing detective" on radio's "Richard Diamond, Private Detective" (1949), crooning to girlfriend Helen Asher at the end of each episode.

2580_111686	 Syria, 1937: Hercule Poirot is one of several people present at an archaeological dig to find the skull of St John the Baptist, led by the exuberant Lord Boynton and his loyal son Leonard. The enterprise has been financed by Boynton's rich, rude and overbearing American wife. She bullies her three adopted children, Carol, Jinny and Raymond, as well as the family's nanny. Sarah King, a young English doctor, falls for Raymond and would love to tear him from his mother's apron-strings, and another doctor, Dr Gerard, takes an interest in Jinny, as does a Polish nun, who, with Jinny, is subject to an attack - by white slavers, according to the independent travel-writer Dame Celia Westholme. A mysterious young American, Jefferson Cope, whose link to the Boyntons seems tenuous, completes the group. Only his Lordship has any love for his wife so that, when she is found stabbed to death one blisteringly hot afternoon, Poirot has more than his fair share of suspects to interrogate. Hercule Poirot is in Syria. He is part of a party accompanying Lord Boynton, a famous archaeologist, on a dig to find the skull of John the Baptist. Also in the party are Lady Boynton, an evil ogre of a woman, and the main target of her malice - Lord Boynton's three children (she is not their mother, as they were born to a previous wife of his). One day, Lady Boynton is found stabbed to death. Poirot investigates but, due to the seemingly universal dislike for the woman, the suspects are many. Plus, the murder seems impossible as she was in plain view when the deed was supposed to have occurred. At an archaeological dig in the Middle East, Hercule Poirot finds himself investigating the death of Lady Boynton, the wife of the expedition leader Lord Boynton. She had been visiting with her three children and their now elderly nanny and was greatly disliked by virtually everyone who came into contact with her. Other visiting the site include Dr. Sarah King, Jefferson Cope, Lord Boynton's son Leonard, Dame Celia Westholme and Dr. Gerard. From all accounts, the dead woman was nothing short of cruel to her children and others put in her care. This proves to be the motivation underlying her murder.	 In South America the Saint meets two swindlers, Alice Nestor and her father. They show him a golden statue of a frog, claiming it is one of many such icons of the sacred frogs of the Incas and request that the Saint backs their expedition to find others.
